With one twist. The layers are really just tags. A shape (component, container, content) can be in zero, one or more layers. I have the ability to turn layers on or off. All objects that participate in that layer will turn on/off with the layer visibility.<br /><br />The visual glue that holds this together is the ability to snap together storyboard frames and walk through the frames which drives turning layers on or off.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/30/58655451_8fb8ce47fe_o.png\" alt=\"Storyboard Example\" /><br /><br />In this example, the user scenario (storyboard) is called <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Swap Shift</span>. The respective steps are clicking on the desired shift, entering search criteria, checking to see if the schedule change will be what they want and finally submitting the request for the swap.<br /><br />In Visio, as I <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">double-click</span> each storyboard step that part of the interface becomes visible. This simulates interaction with the application in a staged movie-style manner. Double-clicking the header resets the scenario to the beginning state. You can view an <a href=\"http://billwscott.com/files/storyboard-movie.avi\">animation</a> of this to see it in action.<br /><br />The feedback has been very favorable. We have used this toolset to present a very complex application to a set of customers that have traditionally been hard to nail down and communicate with. They expressed a real appreciation for getting a chance to observe the interaction at much more intuitive way than traditional functional specs or wireframes.<br /><br />There are issues of course.<br /><ul>   <li>I have tried to make it simple to configure each step as to which layers turn on or off. It is still can be tedious if you get a large number of layers.</li>   <li>It does not display more advanced effects like: zoom, fade, puff, slide, etc. Although these could be written as VB scripts and mostly simulated with an expanded syntax for each storyboard shape.</li>   <li>How to communicate in printing? Well you can tell which layers print or not. So you just have to take the extra step to specify what will show up for a printout.</li> </ul> One thing we have considered is just capturing the whole walkthrough in a movie or flash file and using this as part of our documentation (with voice over.)<br /><br />I hope to publish a much expanded version of this with detailed examples as well as the stencil library. I am awaiting the editoral staff's decision.","html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\">Background</span><br />I started designing (and developing) user interfaces professionally 20 years ago.

All objects that participate in that layer will turn on/off with the layer visibility.<br /><br />The visual glue that holds this together is the ability to snap together storyboard frames and walk through the frames which drives turning layers on or off.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/30/58655451_8fb8ce47fe_o.png\" alt=\"Storyboard Example\" /><br /><br />In this example, the user scenario (storyboard) is called <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Swap Shift</span>. The respective steps are clicking on the desired shift, entering search criteria, checking to see if the schedule change will be what they want and finally submitting the request for the swap.<br /><br />In Visio, as I <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">double-click</span> each storyboard step that part of the interface becomes visible. This simulates interaction with the application in a staged movie-style manner. Double-clicking the header resets the scenario to the beginning state. You can view an <a href=\"http://billwscott.com/files/storyboard-movie.avi\">animation</a> of this to see it in action.<br /><br />The feedback has been very favorable. We have used this toolset to present a very complex application to a set of customers that have traditionally been hard to nail down and communicate with. They expressed a real appreciation for getting a chance to observe the interaction at much more intuitive way than traditional functional specs or wireframes.<br /><br />There are issues of course.<br /><ul>   <li>I have tried to make it simple to configure each step as to which layers turn on or off. It is still can be tedious if you get a large number of layers.</li>   <li>It does not display more advanced effects like: zoom, fade, puff, slide, etc. Although these could be written as VB scripts and mostly simulated with an expanded syntax for each storyboard shape.</li>   <li>How to communicate in printing? Well you can tell which layers print or not. So you just have to take the extra step to specify what will show up for a printout.</li> </ul> One thing we have considered is just capturing the whole walkthrough in a movie or flash file and using this as part of our documentation (with voice over.)<br /><br />I hope to publish a much expanded version of this with detailed examples as well as the stencil library. I am awaiting the editoral staff's decision.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2013-12-24T03:12:50.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2013-12-24T03:12:50.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2005-05-28T18:51:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":9,"uuid":"f60fdf0d-8c39-45bc-a09a-b5f8e37e6d96","title":"Mind Mapping Design Patterns","slug":"mind-mapping-design-patterns","markdown":"I have long been fascinated with design patterns.<br /><br />My first real encounter was in the field of software design when the classic book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201633612/102-3096595-3156129?v=glance\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Design Patterns</span></a> by the so called Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides).<br /><br />Many of the patterns I had already been using. I just did not know to call them patterns. For example, the classic Model-View-Controller pattern had been something I had known about since reading the original <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201136880/qid=1117312216/sr=8-8/ref=pd_ka_1/102-3096595-3156129?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846\">Smalltalk</a> book. It gave a clean way of designing user interfaces. Keeping the model (data), controller (events) and view (page/screen) separate from each other.<br /><br />Later, when at <a href=\"http://www.i2.com/\">i2</a> Technologies, I wrestled with creating a common user interface across our products as well as a common platform of technology. This drove me to look across all of our products. Of necessity you start to see patterns emerge. I kept thinking about coming up with a list of best practices or design patterns for interaction. But, I guess I was not clear enough in my thinking to really put it together then (1998.)<br /><br />I think I was thinking more about interaction design principles than patterns.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\">Definitions</span><br />Ok, a few definitions are in order. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Design principles</span> are foundation concepts that help guide and shape us. Sort of a moral compass to good design. For example, the Xerox PARC adage to <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Keep Information in Context</span> is a powerful design principle. It reminds us to first of present information and not just data. And to present it in proximity or in relationship with the context to interpret the data with. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Style guidelines</span> are specific rules that govern the usage of interface components, container and content. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Design Patterns</span> are best practices that express a practice in context of the user's problem focused by the design constraint.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\">Patterns, Patterns Everywhere</span><br />When I arrived at Sabre (Airline Solutions) to create a User Experience Team, one of the first things I did was to start a masochistic effort to evaluate about 25 of our products performing an in-depth analysis at the screen by screen level as well as noting the systemic issues. After spending a solid 4 months doing nothing but using our products, learning their quirks and looking at every screen I saw a negative set of patterns appear that I typically label <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">anti-patterns</span>. And as I pitched solutions I saw the same ones emerging over and over.<br /><br />Now one would have thought (given my love for google since the first days it went beta) I would have googled' around for interaction design patterns. So as I later did research I found three basic sites that contain a good number of design patterns enumerated. Here they are listed in order of relevance and detail:<br /><ul>   <li><a href=\"http://www.welie.com/\">Welie's Interaction Design Patterns</a><br /></li>   <li><a href=\"http://time-tripper.com/uipatterns/Introduction\">Tidwell's UI Patterns &amp; Techniques</a></li>   <li><a href=\"http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/salaakso/patterns/\">Laakso's User Interface Design Patterns</a></li> </ul><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\"> Design Pattern Library</span><br />At Sabre we are working on an initiative to document interaction design patterns.<br /><br />One of the things that frustrated me about the patterns is that they are hard to categorize. The current sites try to put them in strict categories. This works for the most part but leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />I think a faceted approach would be better and hope to one day get around to that on a domain I have reserved (uipatterns.org).<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\">Enter Mind Mapping</span><br />Have you heard of <a href=\"http://www.mind-map.com/EN/mindmaps/definition.html\">Mind Maps</a>? Its sort of like graphically doodling what is on the brain and capturing the associations between the thoughts as they emerge. With the right tool it is a very freeing exercise in brainstorming. There are a number of software products that provide ways to mind map. My favorite is <a href=\"http://www.mindjet.com/us/\">Mind Manager</a>.<br /><br />Well, I needed a new way to think about the patterns. So I took the concept of Mind Mapping and applied to a set of design patterns.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\">Where It Led Me</span><br />Ok, I didn't know where it would lead me. I just sort of started typing in pattern names as bubbles on the page. Then I started associating them. Soon I started thinking, \"Ok, if I keep going this way I will just keep re-arranging and never get done.\" So I stopped and asked the question that we always as the teams we design for, \"Who is the user and what is her goal?\"<br /><br />Duh! When I asked that question I suddenly decided to take a goal-oriented approach to the user. Each design pattern follows roughly the same pattern:<br /><ul>   <li>Pattern Name</li>   <li>Problem</li>   <li>Use When<br /></li>   <li>Solution</li>   <li>Examples</li> </ul> I saw clearly that the problem was just the user's goal. And the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">use when</span> is just the design constraints placed by the system. The tension is between <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">user goals </span>and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">system constraints</span>. So suddenly I saw a clean division between the patterns. One half could be structured to follow the user's goals. The other half the designer's constraints.<br /><br />So I created one bubble just for the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">User</span> and one just for the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Designer.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/24/58655458_1a0955efe6_o.png\" /><br /><br /></span>I also added a third bubble for Design Principles. Just ignore that for this discussion.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\">User's Goals</span><br />As I looked at the goals I started seeing just a smaller set of basic goals. Appropriate patterns that address the goal can be added as leaf nodes in the mind map.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/26/58655475_f7852f5f40_o.png\" /><br /><br />As I began to fill in each node, I discovered that this was a very natural way to express the organization of the design patterns.<br /><br />Notice on the right hand side of the white bubbles I placed some gray bubbles that express a constraint. On the left is goal leading up to it and a constraint on the right choosing the right patterns.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\">Designer's Contraints<br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"></span></span>On the designer side I started listing constraints that were governing the patterns. These are patterns that are primarily driven by the constraints. In many ways these are patterns that do not apply specifically to a goal.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/26/58655412_718bbbdd37_o.png\" /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\">Practical Outcome of this Exercise</span><br />What this mind map arrived at was a way to find patterns based on the user's goals and based on design constraints. These are the two factors we as designers use in going to our toolbox. The other categorizations are useful but don't match my mental model of how I find a pattern for usage.<br /><br />What would this look like on a patterns site? Well besides providing text search and faceted search, a pattern finder wizard could lead a designer to ideas on solving a problem (or show him we are missing patterns for this problem.) Its a pattern itself. The <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">TroubleShooter </span>pattern.

In writing about and discussing it I have noticed what a pain it is to succintly point out the differences between the old model and the new.<br /><br />So what really is the difference between the old and the new?<br /><br />Well, the traditional web has this model:<br /><br /><ul><li>The user enters information at the page level or clicks on a link to go to another page<br /></li><li>The page refreshes to show the result of the user’s request<br /></li><li>Everything is framed in the context of a page or document that has content<br /></li></ul>And the new web (I know its really not new) has this model:<br /><ul><li>The user interacts with items on the page and the feedback is immediate.</li><li>The page does not have to refresh to complete the user’s interaction</li><li>The page can be more like a canvas or desktop with content being objects the user interacts with</li></ul><br />Most of the time I just call this new web model RIAs (Rich Internet Applications). Its both short and long (ah! the beauty of an acronym!)<br /><br />But what do we call this traditional, previous, older thingy?<br /><br />Well it really is a page-based interaction model. Applications built with this page-based approach are really Paged Internet Applications, or PIAs. Or perhaps, they could be called Page-Based Applications (PBAs). But for symmetry (and maybe subtle confusion :-) we could talk about PIAs vs. RIAs.<br /><br />What do you think? Certainly someone has to have a better idea?<br /><br />BTW, I am aware of Web 1.0 vs. Web 2.0.

It discusses using Microsoft Visio for animating rich interactions. I discuss this briefly in a <a href=\"interactive-wireframes-documenting-rias\">prior blog</a>.<br /><br />Photoshop CS and CS2 introduced some new features that make it easy to simulate complex interactions including animated transitions.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Layered Comps</span><br />Photoshop CS brought us the wonderful world of <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">layered comps</span>. You can now name the layer configuration. The layer order, visibility, layer styles, and element positions are saved.<br /><br />It is sort of like being able to take a photo snapshot of the current state of the design.<br /><br />Its purpose is to create alternate designs and give them a name. Then the designer can walk through the different comp designs with a customer to choose the best one among them.<br /><br />In the world of rich interactions, we can take a snapshot of the user interface at each interesting event state or user interaction.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Animation Palette</span><br />Photoshop CS2 brought an animation palette. By adding layered comps to the each frame of an animation, you can play the various layered comps. Think of it being able to play back a set of complex interactions.<br /><br />A cool feature is the ability to create <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">tweening</span> between frames.<br /><br />An example is I could have two rectangles positioned and named as a layered comp called <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">rectangles. </span>The next comp could switch these rectangles. This could be called <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">swapped_rectangles</span>. Dragging these two layered comps into the animation palette will create two steps to the animation: rectangles in their original position and rectangles in their final position. Not too exciting, right? Now select both frames in the animation palette and tell it to <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">tween</span> and allow it to create 10 frames. Now we have 12 frames total.<br /><br />When you run the animation, notice that the rectangles look like they are swapping. The in-between frames make the animation look convincing.<br /><br /> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Capture the Movie</span><br /> Simplest way is to use a video capture tool (like SnapZ Pro for the Mac) to create a movie file of the interaction as it is played in Photoshop. The movie can be distributed to illustrate the interaction.<br /><br />The combination of layered comps, animation, and video capture create a simple way to illustrate cinematic effects and complex interactions in a page.","html":"<p>Sometime in the next month my article for boxesandarrows.com will finally appear.

You can now name the layer configuration. The layer order, visibility, layer styles, and element positions are saved.<br /><br />It is sort of like being able to take a photo snapshot of the current state of the design.<br /><br />Its purpose is to create alternate designs and give them a name. Then the designer can walk through the different comp designs with a customer to choose the best one among them.<br /><br />In the world of rich interactions, we can take a snapshot of the user interface at each interesting event state or user interaction.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Animation Palette</span><br />Photoshop CS2 brought an animation palette. By adding layered comps to the each frame of an animation, you can play the various layered comps. Think of it being able to play back a set of complex interactions.<br /><br />A cool feature is the ability to create <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">tweening</span> between frames.<br /><br />An example is I could have two rectangles positioned and named as a layered comp called <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">rectangles. </span>The next comp could switch these rectangles. This could be called <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">swapped_rectangles</span>. Dragging these two layered comps into the animation palette will create two steps to the animation: rectangles in their original position and rectangles in their final position. Not too exciting, right? Now select both frames in the animation palette and tell it to <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">tween</span> and allow it to create 10 frames. Now we have 12 frames total.<br /><br />When you run the animation, notice that the rectangles look like they are swapping. The in-between frames make the animation look convincing.<br /><br /> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Capture the Movie</span><br /> Simplest way is to use a video capture tool (like SnapZ Pro for the Mac) to create a movie file of the interaction as it is played in Photoshop. The movie can be distributed to illustrate the interaction.<br /><br />The combination of layered comps, animation, and video capture create a simple way to illustrate cinematic effects and complex interactions in a page.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2013-12-24T03:12:50.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2013-12-24T03:12:50.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2005-11-11T09:45:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":16,"uuid":"a4dc4bbc-a96d-4bbb-a143-babdc780d839","title":"The Come To Me Web","slug":"the-come-to-me-web","markdown":"Tonight I attended the BayCHI event, <a href=\"http://www.baychi.org/calendar/20050809/\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Are You Ready for Web 2.0?</span></a> The panelist were David Sifry, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/\">Technorati</a>; Stewart Butterfield, <a href=\"http://flickr.com/\">Flickr</a>/<a href=\"http://yahoo.com/\">Yahoo</a>!; Paul Rademacher, <a href=\"http://housingmaps.com/\">HousingMaps</a>; Thomas Vander Wal, <a href=\"http://personalinfocloud.com/\">PersonalInfoCloud.com</a>.<br /><br />Wikipedia defines Web 2.0 as:<br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Web 2.0 defines a newer incarnation of the World Wide Web typified by the transition from the typical website hosting HTML/XHTML pages, to a platform that provides a point of presence (sometimes known as a Web portal), from which any of the following interactions may occur: syndication, aggregation, publishing, etc.</span><br /><br />My previous blog struggles with what to call the narrower slice of this platform that centers around rich in-page user experience vs. the old page-based model.

And then having to scroll to the bottom and hit the \"next page?\". In the words of Andy Rooney, \"I know am!\" What I normally do is search, scroll through results to the bottom of the page, scroll back up to double-check, then I have to scroll back down to navigate to the next page. Seems like a lot of bother to just move through my results.<br /><br />Have you ever thought that there could be a better way -- or at least an alternative to the standard google paging control?<br /><br /><a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/30/58655423_50eaf89e86.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/30/58655423_50eaf89e86.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">First a Little History</span>At Sabre, we started experimenting with managing very large data sets with HTML tables. Our in-house table component had grown very rich in features (things like inline editing, sorting, selection, multi-sort, custom editors, row re-arrangement, grouping and other desktop-like features). But one thing we were not happy with was its handling of large sets of data.<br /><br />Our table supported two styles of navigation: scrolling and paging. With scrolling you could create a natural way to interact with the data-- but if you had a lot of records just the amount of HTML that was required to download to the page made it unusable once you got over 1000 records.<br /><br />We supported paging early on to address this issue. The user chooses the page by selecting a specific page number or using the next/previous paging controls.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/28/58655407_89e5465d10.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/28/58655407_89e5465d10.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><br />One nice feature I added was a pre-calculation of the first and last field values of each page for the sorted column. I then displayed this in a page navigation combo box.<br /><br />This allowed the user to navigate to a particular part of the data without having to guess which page. Additionally, I added tooltips that showed what each page contained. This worked fairly well.<br /><br />However, most clients really wanted us to make the table a scrolling table. This was not feasible due to large data sets.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Dilema</span><br />The catalyst came when we were designing a new web application. Initially all of the design discussions pointed to tables with less than 500 records. Since the user needed to select multiple values within the table we designed the screens to use the scrolling variety of our table. However, soon after implementation started the design requirements changed (!) and now we had to deal with 10's of thousands of flights.<br />Now we could have moved them to our paging table. However, given the requirement for the user to move through the flights and make multiple selections before moving to the next step, we were concerned with the usability of this approach. First, would users really think their flight would still be selected after paging to the next set of results? Seeing the page refresh does not make one think everything has been kept. Second, the user really wanted scrolling tables.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Enter Ajax</span><br />So what we settled on was to take the existing paging table and turn all page and sort requests into Ajax-based requests. Our theory was that if the transition between pages was almost instanteous without a page refresh then the user would be able to 1) understand selection was persistent, 2) be able to move through the data quickly. It turned out that performance was excellent. And since it was faster there was less confusion about whether selection was maintained while paging.<br />Darren James (on my team) did an incredible job of squeezing more and more optimizations out of the ajax response/update. It was his work on the table, cinematic effects and drag &amp; drop that brought about the Rico framework.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">User Feedback</span><br />The users absolutely love it! They couldn't believe the responsiveness they were getting from a table in a web application. But they still had one request. They wanted to control the table by scrolling. And they wanted it to be fast even with large data sets.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Scrolling Ajax Table</span><br />So after launching Rico (<a href=\"http://openrico.org/\">http://openrico.org</a>) Darren, Richard Cowin and I felt that this would be the right thing to tackle. We all felt that it should start as a lightweight behavior. <a href=\"http://openrico.org/behaviorFeatures.page\">Behaviors</a> in Rico are just JavaScript logic and/or layout that gets applied to raw HTML. In this case we are applying just the logic of hooking up an HTML table to any arbitrary set of data via Ajax. Other behaviors (sorting, filtering, reordering, etc.) are planned later.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Introducing LiveGrid Behavior</span><br />By applying the LiveGrid behavior, your HTML table gets connected to any size data set and it gets adorned with a scrollbar to control the navigation. The scroller becomes the replacement for the standard Previous/Next page controller bar. When dragging the scroll bar you are actually issuing ajax commands to pull the data into the table in real time! Of course we provide data caching and event buffering strategies to minimize the number of requests and smooth out the scrolling.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Death to Paging?</span><br />First, let me say that I really don't believe that paging is evil or that it is wrong in all cases. But I believe the reason that most sites have paging solutions is because 1) its easy to implement, 2) handles the problem of large sets of data and 3) it is convention.<br /><br />Rarely is paging decided because it is the better choice over something like scrolling. (I should hasten to add that I do discuss some of the cons of scrolling later in this article.)<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Our Pitch</span><br />So, here is what we are advocating. We would like people to start thinking about replacing the paging data model with the more inuitive scrolling data model. It is not an accident that for years this has been a good model on the desktop. And there have been a number of tables built in the desktop or applet world that do exactly what LiveGrid does-- connect up to a virtual set of data and allow you to scroll through it. In fact, I wrote a table to do this very thing in 1998 for the Java Swing framework.<br /><br />So we are hoping the release of LiveGrid will create a dialogue of discussion around the best way for users to move through information on the web and in web applications. We need better ways of displaying search results, product lists, real estate listings, etc. on the web.<br /><br />To help you understand some of the possible impact we provide two demos for the scrolling LiveGrid.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Pitch #1: To the Corporate World: You Can Do It on the Web!</span><br />The first example demonstrates a table with around 1000 movies accessible. Only ten are shown and possibly 30 are cached on the browser at any given time. By scrolling the table, the database is queried to return more data just in time and on-the-fly.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/28/58655407_89e5465d10.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/28/58655407_89e5465d10.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><br />One of the big reasons we did not take more applications at Sabre to the web was the inability to manage in a user friendly, easy manner large sets of data in tables. The LiveGrid concept solves this problem. Think of it as GoogleGrids (aka, GoogleMaps)!<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Pitch #2: To the Web World: Show Results in a Scrolling LiveGrid</span><br />I worked up a search engine example using the excellent <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.net/\">Yahoo Search Services API</a>. This illustrates what a search engine page could look like with the LiveGrid behavior. Its really quite fun to play with. I have demonstrated it to computer novices who are not easily enamored by technical stuff. Their response has been, \"Why don't they already do it this way?\"<br /><br /><a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/29/58655484_03fa649bb5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/29/58655484_03fa649bb5.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />In the Yahoo Search example, we are bringing back live data from the search (usually around 35 rows for caching). Then as you scroll we are buffering as needed around you. The result is you can jump anywhere in the search data. Currently, the scroller is limited to 1000 results (the limit placed by the Yahoo Search API).<br /><br /><div style=\"clear:both;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Pros</span></div><ul>   <li>Familiarity. Anyone who has used a PC/Mac is familar with a scrollbar</li>   <li>Ease of use. Just scroll it baby.</li>   <li>Control is visible along the side, not hidden at the bottom</li>   <li>Shows you how much data you have and where you are in relation</li>   <li>With the tooltip and the results feedback it provides you something to watch and helps you to navigate while data loads.</li>   <li>I don't have to configure how much I want to see on a page. Designers decide what works best and then you can just scroll through it.<br /></li> </ul> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Cons</span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"></span><br /><ul>   <li>The old problem of I have two scrollbars. One in the window around the results the other on the page itself. [Solutions: make scrollbar styled differently? Keep the complete scroller above the fold]</li>   <li>If you have millions of results, you might not want to set the scroller extent to millions. The granularity of the scroll bar gets to be too small. However, it would be fascinating to actually scroll down to those last results. Anybody actually seen those? Do we even know if they exist ;-)</li>   <li>Scroller extending below the page fold. Perhaps the best use is to keep the scrolled area completely above the fold. But hey, since you can scroll so fast through your data you won't miss the few extra rows of information below the fold (that you had to scroll to anyway.)</li> </ul><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Feedback Design Considerations<br /></span>We have experimented with several ideas to provide adequate feedback. During scrolling at certain points (when crossing a buffer boundary) there can be a slight delay. We plan on adding a twirling wheel (as in Firefox or Mac) just above the scrollbar and to the right of the status to indicate when the table is busy fetching data. Is this the right approach? The balance here is to not show it too often. It should be a lot like Dunstan Orchard's Live Search on his http://1976design.com/blog which waits to search when the user pauses so the number of updates is minimized.<br /><br />We added a tooltip (right now it does not fade away-- thats a bug -- but I have come to like it the way it is :-) that shows which record you are currently scrolling through. Also I dynamically update the status bar to show the range of records that are being scrolled through. I think both together give enough assurance that something is happening even with a slight delay in loading data. Certainly there are other ways to provide the feeling of scrolling while waiting slightly for data to flow in.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Your Feedback</span><br />Ultimately, its everyone in the application and web community that that will judge if the time is ripe for banishing many of the ubiquitous Prev/Next Page bars in favor of the scrollbar.<br />I am convinced this technique has important implications in the corporate application world and has the potential to change the way we interact with many of the search results, product listings and data grids we find on the web.<br /><br />We welcome your <a href=\"mailto:dev@rico.tigris.org\">feedback</a>!<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Demos</span><br />You can find the two demos at:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://openrico.org/demos/livegrid\">http://openrico.org/demos/livegrid</a><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Note: This link is broken as of 2007.

And they wanted it to be fast even with large data sets.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Scrolling Ajax Table</span><br />So after launching Rico (<a href=\"http://openrico.org/\">http://openrico.org</a>) Darren, Richard Cowin and I felt that this would be the right thing to tackle. We all felt that it should start as a lightweight behavior. <a href=\"http://openrico.org/behaviorFeatures.page\">Behaviors</a> in Rico are just JavaScript logic and/or layout that gets applied to raw HTML. In this case we are applying just the logic of hooking up an HTML table to any arbitrary set of data via Ajax. Other behaviors (sorting, filtering, reordering, etc.) are planned later.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Introducing LiveGrid Behavior</span><br />By applying the LiveGrid behavior, your HTML table gets connected to any size data set and it gets adorned with a scrollbar to control the navigation. The scroller becomes the replacement for the standard Previous/Next page controller bar. When dragging the scroll bar you are actually issuing ajax commands to pull the data into the table in real time! Of course we provide data caching and event buffering strategies to minimize the number of requests and smooth out the scrolling.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Death to Paging?</span><br />First, let me say that I really don't believe that paging is evil or that it is wrong in all cases. But I believe the reason that most sites have paging solutions is because 1) its easy to implement, 2) handles the problem of large sets of data and 3) it is convention.<br /><br />Rarely is paging decided because it is the better choice over something like scrolling. (I should hasten to add that I do discuss some of the cons of scrolling later in this article.)<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Our Pitch</span><br />So, here is what we are advocating. We would like people to start thinking about replacing the paging data model with the more inuitive scrolling data model. It is not an accident that for years this has been a good model on the desktop. And there have been a number of tables built in the desktop or applet world that do exactly what LiveGrid does-- connect up to a virtual set of data and allow you to scroll through it. In fact, I wrote a table to do this very thing in 1998 for the Java Swing framework.<br /><br />So we are hoping the release of LiveGrid will create a dialogue of discussion around the best way for users to move through information on the web and in web applications. We need better ways of displaying search results, product lists, real estate listings, etc. on the web.<br /><br />To help you understand some of the possible impact we provide two demos for the scrolling LiveGrid.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Pitch #1: To the Corporate World: You Can Do It on the Web!</span><br />The first example demonstrates a table with around 1000 movies accessible. Only ten are shown and possibly 30 are cached on the browser at any given time. By scrolling the table, the database is queried to return more data just in time and on-the-fly.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/28/58655407_89e5465d10.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/28/58655407_89e5465d10.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><br />One of the big reasons we did not take more applications at Sabre to the web was the inability to manage in a user friendly, easy manner large sets of data in tables. The LiveGrid concept solves this problem. Think of it as GoogleGrids (aka, GoogleMaps)!<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Pitch #2: To the Web World: Show Results in a Scrolling LiveGrid</span><br />I worked up a search engine example using the excellent <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.net/\">Yahoo Search Services API</a>. This illustrates what a search engine page could look like with the LiveGrid behavior. Its really quite fun to play with. I have demonstrated it to computer novices who are not easily enamored by technical stuff. Their response has been, \"Why don't they already do it this way?\"<br /><br /><a href=\"http://static.flickr.com/29/58655484_03fa649bb5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/29/58655484_03fa649bb5.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />In the Yahoo Search example, we are bringing back live data from the search (usually around 35 rows for caching). Then as you scroll we are buffering as needed around you. The result is you can jump anywhere in the search data. Currently, the scroller is limited to 1000 results (the limit placed by the Yahoo Search API).<br /><br /><div style=\"clear:both;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Pros</span></div><ul>   <li>Familiarity. Anyone who has used a PC/Mac is familar with a scrollbar</li>   <li>Ease of use. Just scroll it baby.</li>   <li>Control is visible along the side, not hidden at the bottom</li>   <li>Shows you how much data you have and where you are in relation</li>   <li>With the tooltip and the results feedback it provides you something to watch and helps you to navigate while data loads.</li>   <li>I don't have to configure how much I want to see on a page. Designers decide what works best and then you can just scroll through it.<br /></li> </ul> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Cons</span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"></span><br /><ul>   <li>The old problem of I have two scrollbars. One in the window around the results the other on the page itself. [Solutions: make scrollbar styled differently? Keep the complete scroller above the fold]</li>   <li>If you have millions of results, you might not want to set the scroller extent to millions. The granularity of the scroll bar gets to be too small. However, it would be fascinating to actually scroll down to those last results. Anybody actually seen those? Do we even know if they exist ;-)</li>   <li>Scroller extending below the page fold. Perhaps the best use is to keep the scrolled area completely above the fold. But hey, since you can scroll so fast through your data you won't miss the few extra rows of information below the fold (that you had to scroll to anyway.)</li> </ul><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Feedback Design Considerations<br /></span>We have experimented with several ideas to provide adequate feedback. During scrolling at certain points (when crossing a buffer boundary) there can be a slight delay. We plan on adding a twirling wheel (as in Firefox or Mac) just above the scrollbar and to the right of the status to indicate when the table is busy fetching data. Is this the right approach? The balance here is to not show it too often. It should be a lot like Dunstan Orchard's Live Search on his <a href='http://1976design.com/blog'>http://1976design.com/blog</a> which waits to search when the user pauses so the number of updates is minimized.<br /><br />We added a tooltip (right now it does not fade away-- thats a bug -- but I have come to like it the way it is :-) that shows which record you are currently scrolling through. Also I dynamically update the status bar to show the range of records that are being scrolled through. I think both together give enough assurance that something is happening even with a slight delay in loading data. Certainly there are other ways to provide the feeling of scrolling while waiting slightly for data to flow in.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Your Feedback</span><br />Ultimately, its everyone in the application and web community that that will judge if the time is ripe for banishing many of the ubiquitous Prev/Next Page bars in favor of the scrollbar.<br />I am convinced this technique has important implications in the corporate application world and has the potential to change the way we interact with many of the search results, product listings and data grids we find on the web.<br /><br />We welcome your <a href=\"mailto:<a href='mailto:dev@rico.tigris.org'>dev@rico.tigris.org</a>\">feedback</a>!<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Demos</span><br />You can find the two demos at:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://openrico.org/demos/livegrid\">http://openrico.org/demos/livegrid</a><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Note: This link is broken as of 2007.

The new social browser scheduled for an October release. Oh no, you say. Not another browser!<br /><br />No, its not really a <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">new</span> browser.<br /><br />Flock brilliantly chose to use the Firefox engine (Gecko engine). Flock is an open source browser (like Camino for the Mac) built by some <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/25419820@N00/42757004\">talented guys</a> in Palo Alto, some of which were part of the Mozilla foundation.<br /><br />They keep the gecko layout engine.

Think about functionality added to the chrome that creates a web 2.0 access ramp for the average user.<br /><br />Safari 2.0 made a step in that direction by making RSS subscriptions much easier. Flock appears to go much further.<br /><br />Here are some of it features:<br /><ul>   <li>sharing and tagging bookmarks. They have a partnership with delicious. They include a way to see these in what they call \"bread crumbs\". Bad name. More like tagged bookmarks.</li>   <li>Watching lists of users and being notified as pages are bookmarked<br />  </li>   <li>Blog tool that allows you to drag and drop elements from pages you surf into a shelf that you can later compose into a blog using the common blog publishing tools</li>   <li>Ability to grab snippets and drop them as blockquotes in blogs.</li>   <li>Flickr integration for photo sharing and dropping into blogs directly</li> </ul> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\">DejaVu</span><br />Remember the early desktop operating systems? Did not even have disk fragmenters. Lots of utilities that are standard in the desktop OS now was once built as a little tool that got incorporated later into the OS. Is this where browsers will head? We could have stability on the layout engine (IE, Gecko, Safari being the main ones to consider) but have new browser wars that compete on functionality not just around being able to display a page and support richness.<br /><br />Will IE7 have some of these concepts or did they miss the boat?<br /><br />Extensions to Firefox can do some of this, but really who outside of geekdom actually installs firefox plugins or has used greasemonkey? And how many times has firefox crashed due to rogue extensions.

The new social browser scheduled for an October release. Oh no, you say. Not another browser!<br /><br />No, its not really a <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">new</span> browser.<br /><br />Flock brilliantly chose to use the Firefox engine (Gecko engine). Flock is an open source browser (like Camino for the Mac) built by some <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/25419820@N00/42757004\">talented guys</a> in Palo Alto, some of which were part of the Mozilla foundation.<br /><br />They keep the gecko layout engine. Its just the chrome they mess with.<br /><br />So think about some of the things that really open the web up in the world of Web 2.0.<br /><ul>   <li>Come To Me Web. RSS Syndication</li>   <li>Folksonomy. </li>   <ul>     <li>The tagging phenomon popularized by flickr</li>   </ul>   <ul>     <li>The social bookmarking popularized by delicious</li>   </ul>   <li>Blogging</li>   <ul>     <li>building blogs</li>   </ul>   <ul>     <li>locating blogs</li>   </ul> </ul> Now imagine a browser that makes it easier to do these things. Think about functionality added to the chrome that creates a web 2.0 access ramp for the average user.<br /><br />Safari 2.0 made a step in that direction by making RSS subscriptions much easier. Flock appears to go much further.<br /><br />Here are some of it features:<br /><ul>   <li>sharing and tagging bookmarks. They have a partnership with delicious. They include a way to see these in what they call \"bread crumbs\". Bad name. More like tagged bookmarks.</li>   <li>Watching lists of users and being notified as pages are bookmarked<br />  </li>   <li>Blog tool that allows you to drag and drop elements from pages you surf into a shelf that you can later compose into a blog using the common blog publishing tools</li>   <li>Ability to grab snippets and drop them as blockquotes in blogs.</li>   <li>Flickr integration for photo sharing and dropping into blogs directly</li> </ul> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\">DejaVu</span><br />Remember the early desktop operating systems? Did not even have disk fragmenters. Lots of utilities that are standard in the desktop OS now was once built as a little tool that got incorporated later into the OS. Is this where browsers will head? We could have stability on the layout engine (IE, Gecko, Safari being the main ones to consider) but have new browser wars that compete on functionality not just around being able to display a page and support richness.<br /><br />Will IE7 have some of these concepts or did they miss the boat?<br /><br />Extensions to Firefox can do some of this, but really who outside of geekdom actually installs firefox plugins or has used greasemonkey? And how many times has firefox crashed due to rogue extensions. Its seems natural that browsers will incorporate what the extensions do and will grow like desktop operating systems did.<br /><br />Google has a secret Firefox project going. Aaron Boodman who built greasemonkey is working on that team. Its been rumored that google is going to unleash a new web os based on Firefox.

Yeh, I know I really should get out more often ;-)<br /><br />A mouse hover is a really simple event. When you get a mouseover event you do someting. When you get a mouseout event you usually restore things to the original state.<br /><br />Mouse hovers were virtually unheard of in the desktop user interface world.

It was the advent of the web and the need for discoverability that really opened the door for the lowly hover to be come to the forefront.<br /><br />In the desktop world, hovers were not that immediately useful. It seemed gratuitous and redundant in those early days to do something on a mouse hover. Traditional desktop apps have always been structured around user interface controls providing the structure with data poured into this mold. Web sites &amp; applications started with content. With hyperlinks and images embedded in the page, it was not obvious what the 'control' or navigation structure of the page was without some visual clues. Over time rollover effects that made it into the web found themselves migrating to the desktop.<br /><br />Windows 95 flattened toolbars to remove the visual speed bumbs created by beveled button borders. In its place, the mouse hover showed the border and gave the essential clue that the object was clickable. As more and more folks have got used to exploring with a mouse hover, it became a more acceptable a way to discover functionality.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\">Ajax, DHTML and the Lowly Hover</span><br />Now that interactions are even more dense, the hover has become our friend to discoverability. We are introducing new idioms to the web space. Things like drag and drop and inline editability are not immediately expected. The hover can provide vital clues to the behavior of an application at the moment the user is curious about it. Hovers are also the lightest event for the user (they just move the mouse.)<br /><br />Let's look at some places that hover is showing up more and more (not an exhaustive list!)<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\">Hover Invitation<br /></span>We can use the hover to cue the user what is going to happen next.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;\">Inline editing</span><br />How would you know that parts of a web page's content is editable? We could be overt and just say it on the page. But that gets busy if there are lots of places that are editable. We could make everything look editable. But that also makes for a cluttered page. Hover lets us do <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">just-in-time</span> functionality feedback.<br /><br />In flickr, hover over the photo title and you will see the color change to indicate the area has some interaction to offer. Coupled with the tooltip the user is invited to click to edit the title.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/33/61998296_fefcb7aa13_o.png\" alt=\"hover-flickr-1.png\" height=\"73\" width=\"375\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Flickr's Photo Title Before Hover</span></span><br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/26/61998299_c218dd857d_o.png\" alt=\"hover-flickr-2.png\" height=\"73\" width=\"375\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Flickr's Photo Title After Hover</span></span><br /><br />Pretty obvious if the user ever hovers over the title.<br /><br />In backpackit.com, the 37 Signals folks take a similar approach. They shad the area editable with a gradiated yellow background and add a lightweight inline, incontext toolset. It becomes obvious that you can edit, delete (trash can not shown below), etc. the content.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/25/61998288_f25434a12f_o.png\" alt=\"hover-backpackit-1.png\" height=\"77\" width=\"408\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Backpackit Note - Non Editable</span></span><br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/32/61998290_3743966614_o.png\" alt=\"hover-backpackit-2.png\" height=\"77\" width=\"408\" /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:85%;\">Backpackit Note - Showing Editability</span><br /><br />In Yahoo's trip planner (travel.yahoo.com/trip) you get the same style of in-context toolsets on hover.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/29/61998348_02a3caca89_o.png\" alt=\"hover-trip-tools-1.png\" height=\"60\" width=\"408\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Y!

Travel's Trip Planner - Showing Editability</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;\">Ratings</span><br />Yahoo popularized ratings. Just check out how the hover helps guide a user to rate a movie.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/32/61998328_1b81ad7428_o.png\" alt=\"hover-movies-invitation-1.png\" height=\"92\" width=\"146\" /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:85%;\">Yahoo!

Movies Ratings - Invitation to Rate</span></span><br /><br />By visually engaging the user in rating possibilities the user only needs to click to participate. This lightweight approach to engagement is the advantage the hover has. Hover requires little effort. The next step is just to click.<br /><br />Hover is nice because it allows you to hide lots of controls and show them only as needed. Showing them in a light enough manner makes it much more engaging to participate.<br /><br />One more example will suffice from Yahoo! Local's Reviews.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/30/61998316_1454e6e773_o.png\" alt=\"hover-local-reviews-1.png\" height=\"132\" width=\"114\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Yahoo!

Local Review Rating - During Hover</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Flagging Mail</span><br />In the new Y! Mail, hovering over a message's column for flagging shows a lightly shaded flag. Clicking turns the flag on.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/29/61998321_7d7ba478aa_o.png\" alt=\"hover-mail-flagging-1.png\" width=\"430\" /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:85%;\">Yahoo!

Mail (Beta) - Inviting to Flag</span></span><br /><br />I think gmail's star could have been greatly improved with the addition of a hover. Although I don't believe that Google believes in the hover event at this point in time ;-)<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/33/61998302_66d2911ca7_o.png\" alt=\"hover-gmail-star.png\" height=\"21\" width=\"228\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Gmail's Star - No Hover</span></span><br /><br />In all of these the hover creates an invitation, a call to action. It shows what the user can do right now, right where they are at.<br /><br />I call this the Hover Invitation.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\">Hover Zoom/Focus</span><br />There is another use for hover. Since the mouse can indicate where I want to look, the hover can say, hey I want to focus here... I want more detail.<br /><br />Getting More Detail<br />local.yahoo.com does this with the map. Try searching for 'restaurants' in some locale and you will see a map to the left. Hovering over the map enlarges it. Leaving the map area shrinks it back to the normal size.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/33/61998307_ca83f61901_o.png\" alt=\"hover-local-map-1.png\" height=\"424\" width=\"427\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Yahoo! Local Map Inset - Before Hover</span></span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/30/61998314_8c24955803_o.png\" alt=\"hover-local-map-2.png\" height=\"424\" width=\"427\" /></span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:85%;\"><br />Yahoo! Local Map Zoomed - After Hover</span><br /><br />This pattern is about Mouse Focus or Mouse Zoom. In this case the hover is the interaction. While it might lead to more interactions, the Hover Invitation is a specific call to action, an invitation to click.<br /><br />However, there are problems with this approach. Once the area is zoomed up it can cover other important areas, controls on the page. The user also has to move a lot further to exit the now enlarged area to get it to shrink down in size. You have to be certain that the user really wants to interact with an object to zoom on hover.<br /><br />This is also common with photo organizing software. Hovering over a photo automatically enlarges it slightly.<br /><br />A very slight variation on this is enlarging an area on hover to make it more apparent it will be the object selected. The Macintosh OS X Dock does this. Although with mixed results. Part of the problem is the area is just magnified. If the icon is 32x32 and it enlarges to 64x64, you still only have 32 pixels of mouse movement to traverse the object. This causes people to zoom past tools by accident.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\">Hover Detail</span><br />And yet another variation is the hover detail. By hovering over something I get a separate view that shows up in a lightweight popup allowing me to see or read more data about an entity. Not too much unlike a the hover zoom, but with more emphasis on letting me peek at more information without changing the page at all.<br /><br />You can see an example of this in netflix.com.<br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/29/61998339_9559d945d0_o.png\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> Netflix Hover Detail</span><br /><br /></span>Also, it is used to get more of the story in news.yahoo.com.<br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/25/61998345_e23bbcc396_o.png\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Yahoo! News Hover Detail</span><br /><br /></span><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Going Forward</span></span><br />Of course, hover will be abused. Once could imagine a page with no controls showing and they only show their action on hover. This is the idea of <a href=\"http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/mysterymeatnavigation.html\">mystery meat interaction</a> a wonderfully hideous approach to engagement.<br /><br />But used wisely, the hover can<br /><ul>   <li>Engage the user at the point of interest</li>   <li>Reduce clutter on the page</li>   <li>Give specific previews as to what will happen if the user clicks</li>   <li>Provide a lighter way to zoom in on things with little effort<br /></li> </ul><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\">Take-Away</span><br />Use hover to create a more lightweight but engaging way to cue the user to hidden functionality. Use it as a way to provide just-in-time details. Use it to keep your page visually simpler providing what is needed when they are most curious.</span>","html":"<p>I've been thinking a lot lately about mouse hovers.

Traditional desktop apps have always been structured around user interface controls providing the structure with data poured into this mold. Web sites &amp; applications started with content. With hyperlinks and images embedded in the page, it was not obvious what the 'control' or navigation structure of the page was without some visual clues. Over time rollover effects that made it into the web found themselves migrating to the desktop.<br /><br />Windows 95 flattened toolbars to remove the visual speed bumbs created by beveled button borders. In its place, the mouse hover showed the border and gave the essential clue that the object was clickable. As more and more folks have got used to exploring with a mouse hover, it became a more acceptable a way to discover functionality.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\">Ajax, DHTML and the Lowly Hover</span><br />Now that interactions are even more dense, the hover has become our friend to discoverability. We are introducing new idioms to the web space. Things like drag and drop and inline editability are not immediately expected. The hover can provide vital clues to the behavior of an application at the moment the user is curious about it. Hovers are also the lightest event for the user (they just move the mouse.)<br /><br />Let's look at some places that hover is showing up more and more (not an exhaustive list!)<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\">Hover Invitation<br /></span>We can use the hover to cue the user what is going to happen next.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;\">Inline editing</span><br />How would you know that parts of a web page's content is editable? We could be overt and just say it on the page. But that gets busy if there are lots of places that are editable. We could make everything look editable. But that also makes for a cluttered page. Hover lets us do <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">just-in-time</span> functionality feedback.<br /><br />In flickr, hover over the photo title and you will see the color change to indicate the area has some interaction to offer. Coupled with the tooltip the user is invited to click to edit the title.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/33/61998296_fefcb7aa13_o.png\" alt=\"hover-flickr-1.png\" height=\"73\" width=\"375\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Flickr's Photo Title Before Hover</span></span><br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/26/61998299_c218dd857d_o.png\" alt=\"hover-flickr-2.png\" height=\"73\" width=\"375\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Flickr's Photo Title After Hover</span></span><br /><br />Pretty obvious if the user ever hovers over the title.<br /><br />In backpackit.com, the 37 Signals folks take a similar approach. They shad the area editable with a gradiated yellow background and add a lightweight inline, incontext toolset. It becomes obvious that you can edit, delete (trash can not shown below), etc. the content.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/25/61998288_f25434a12f_o.png\" alt=\"hover-backpackit-1.png\" height=\"77\" width=\"408\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Backpackit Note - Non Editable</span></span><br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/32/61998290_3743966614_o.png\" alt=\"hover-backpackit-2.png\" height=\"77\" width=\"408\" /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:85%;\">Backpackit Note - Showing Editability</span><br /><br />In Yahoo's trip planner (travel.yahoo.com/trip) you get the same style of in-context toolsets on hover.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/29/61998348_02a3caca89_o.png\" alt=\"hover-trip-tools-1.png\" height=\"60\" width=\"408\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Y!

Travel's Trip Planner - Showing Editability</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;\">Ratings</span><br />Yahoo popularized ratings. Just check out how the hover helps guide a user to rate a movie.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/32/61998328_1b81ad7428_o.png\" alt=\"hover-movies-invitation-1.png\" height=\"92\" width=\"146\" /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:85%;\">Yahoo!

Movies Ratings - Invitation to Rate</span></span><br /><br />By visually engaging the user in rating possibilities the user only needs to click to participate. This lightweight approach to engagement is the advantage the hover has. Hover requires little effort. The next step is just to click.<br /><br />Hover is nice because it allows you to hide lots of controls and show them only as needed. Showing them in a light enough manner makes it much more engaging to participate.<br /><br />One more example will suffice from Yahoo! Local's Reviews.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/30/61998316_1454e6e773_o.png\" alt=\"hover-local-reviews-1.png\" height=\"132\" width=\"114\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Yahoo!

It shows what the user can do right now, right where they are at.<br /><br />I call this the Hover Invitation.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\">Hover Zoom/Focus</span><br />There is another use for hover. Since the mouse can indicate where I want to look, the hover can say, hey I want to focus here... I want more detail.<br /><br />Getting More Detail<br />local.yahoo.com does this with the map. Try searching for 'restaurants' in some locale and you will see a map to the left. Hovering over the map enlarges it. Leaving the map area shrinks it back to the normal size.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/33/61998307_ca83f61901_o.png\" alt=\"hover-local-map-1.png\" height=\"424\" width=\"427\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Yahoo! Local Map Inset - Before Hover</span></span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/30/61998314_8c24955803_o.png\" alt=\"hover-local-map-2.png\" height=\"424\" width=\"427\" /></span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:85%;\"><br />Yahoo! Local Map Zoomed - After Hover</span><br /><br />This pattern is about Mouse Focus or Mouse Zoom. In this case the hover is the interaction. While it might lead to more interactions, the Hover Invitation is a specific call to action, an invitation to click.<br /><br />However, there are problems with this approach. Once the area is zoomed up it can cover other important areas, controls on the page. The user also has to move a lot further to exit the now enlarged area to get it to shrink down in size. You have to be certain that the user really wants to interact with an object to zoom on hover.<br /><br />This is also common with photo organizing software. Hovering over a photo automatically enlarges it slightly.<br /><br />A very slight variation on this is enlarging an area on hover to make it more apparent it will be the object selected. The Macintosh OS X Dock does this. Although with mixed results. Part of the problem is the area is just magnified. If the icon is 32x32 and it enlarges to 64x64, you still only have 32 pixels of mouse movement to traverse the object. This causes people to zoom past tools by accident.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\">Hover Detail</span><br />And yet another variation is the hover detail. By hovering over something I get a separate view that shows up in a lightweight popup allowing me to see or read more data about an entity. Not too much unlike a the hover zoom, but with more emphasis on letting me peek at more information without changing the page at all.<br /><br />You can see an example of this in netflix.com.<br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/29/61998339_9559d945d0_o.png\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> Netflix Hover Detail</span><br /><br /></span>Also, it is used to get more of the story in news.yahoo.com.<br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/25/61998345_e23bbcc396_o.png\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Yahoo! News Hover Detail</span><br /><br /></span><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Going Forward</span></span><br />Of course, hover will be abused. Once could imagine a page with no controls showing and they only show their action on hover. This is the idea of <a href=\"http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/mysterymeatnavigation.html\">mystery meat interaction</a> a wonderfully hideous approach to engagement.<br /><br />But used wisely, the hover can<br /><ul>   <li>Engage the user at the point of interest</li>   <li>Reduce clutter on the page</li>   <li>Give specific previews as to what will happen if the user clicks</li>   <li>Provide a lighter way to zoom in on things with little effort<br /></li> </ul><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\">Take-Away</span><br />Use hover to create a more lightweight but engaging way to cue the user to hidden functionality. Use it as a way to provide just-in-time details. Use it to keep your page visually simpler providing what is needed when they are most curious.</span></p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2013-12-24T03:12:50.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2013-12-24T03:12:50.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2005-11-10T20:49:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":24,"uuid":"a4d24cc4-5b49-4b77-804b-d60a02034bb4","title":"Y!

Specifically I discussed one aspect of the kit-- animating wireframes with Visio. I wrote a fuller article that is just getting around to being published on boxesandarrows.com. It should show up this weekend.<br /><br />In the article, I provide a reference to the fuller wireframe toolkit and they (at boxesandarrows) have agreed to host the installation files. Since I have not really explained the wireframe toolkit nor provided a way to download it before, I felt it would be important to provide a blog article about the kit and how to get it for your own use.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Caveats</span></span><br />Please note. The kit was fine-tuned for our frameworks at Sabre (some of which became the openrico.org project). As such the code generation is only beneficial to those with that framework (sorry, not Rico). However, those that are industrious can open up the Visual Basic Editor in Visio and find the code that generates JSP and Java/Swing code and simply replace it with code to generate PHP, ASP or whatever suits your fancy.<br /><br />Also, the style has been reduced to a mostly color-less variety suitable for wireframes. In the original we had our demo CSS style implemented in Visio. The color-less variety was a really quick hack I did to dumb it down.<br /><br />I don't have any proper documentation. I have included a movie presentation on how some of the features look when someone is using them.<br /><br />And finally, I have spent no time in the last 5 or 6 months refining it. Now that I understand how to create Visio shapes and manipulate them I would do some things differently. I keep thinking it would be nice to clean it up, fully document it and release it. That though was what kept me from sharing it before. So, here it is. Hopefully, some will find it helpful.<br /><h3>Wireframe Prototyping for Visio </h3> Visio is widely used by interaction designers and information architects for creating wireframes. At my previous employer, Sabre, I created an extensive wireframe toolkit for Visio that included such features as: <p> </p> <ul> <li> Complete web component stencil library (including standard components, table, menus, tabs, and tree) </li><li> Fast, intelligent snap-to layout using pre-programmed Visio connectors </li><li> Provide a way to visualize rich interactions (animating a wireframe) </li><li> Intelligent components that have built-in behaviors </li><li> Generate requirements documents from wireframe artifacts </li><li> Generate code from wireframe artifacts </li><li> Automated annotations and callouts </li></ul><ul>   </ul>   <p> </p> <div style=\"border:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding:5px;width:380px;background-color:rgb(231,242,249);\"> <h5><a name=\"Download_Installation\"> </a> <span style=\"font-size:130%;\">Download &amp; Installation </span></h5> The stencil library is available for <a href=\"http://billwscott.com/files/install_visio_wireframe_toolkit.zip\" target=\"_top\">download</a>. <ol><li> Make sure you have Microsoft Visio 2003 installed on your machine.  </li><li> Download the <a href=\"http://billwscott.com/files/install_visio_wireframe_toolkit.zip\" target=\"_top\">zip</a> file </li><li> Unzip this into your <em>C:My DocumentsMy Shapes folder</em>.

Specifically I discussed one aspect of the kit-- animating wireframes with Visio. I wrote a fuller article that is just getting around to being published on boxesandarrows.com. It should show up this weekend.<br /><br />In the article, I provide a reference to the fuller wireframe toolkit and they (at boxesandarrows) have agreed to host the installation files. Since I have not really explained the wireframe toolkit nor provided a way to download it before, I felt it would be important to provide a blog article about the kit and how to get it for your own use.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Caveats</span></span><br />Please note. The kit was fine-tuned for our frameworks at Sabre (some of which became the openrico.org project). As such the code generation is only beneficial to those with that framework (sorry, not Rico). However, those that are industrious can open up the Visual Basic Editor in Visio and find the code that generates JSP and Java/Swing code and simply replace it with code to generate PHP, ASP or whatever suits your fancy.<br /><br />Also, the style has been reduced to a mostly color-less variety suitable for wireframes. In the original we had our demo CSS style implemented in Visio. The color-less variety was a really quick hack I did to dumb it down.<br /><br />I don't have any proper documentation. I have included a movie presentation on how some of the features look when someone is using them.<br /><br />And finally, I have spent no time in the last 5 or 6 months refining it. Now that I understand how to create Visio shapes and manipulate them I would do some things differently. I keep thinking it would be nice to clean it up, fully document it and release it. That though was what kept me from sharing it before. So, here it is. Hopefully, some will find it helpful.<br /><h3>Wireframe Prototyping for Visio </h3> Visio is widely used by interaction designers and information architects for creating wireframes. At my previous employer, Sabre, I created an extensive wireframe toolkit for Visio that included such features as: <p> </p> <ul> <li> Complete web component stencil library (including standard components, table, menus, tabs, and tree) </li><li> Fast, intelligent snap-to layout using pre-programmed Visio connectors </li><li> Provide a way to visualize rich interactions (animating a wireframe) </li><li> Intelligent components that have built-in behaviors </li><li> Generate requirements documents from wireframe artifacts </li><li> Generate code from wireframe artifacts </li><li> Automated annotations and callouts </li></ul><ul>   </ul>   <p> </p> <div style=\"border:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding:5px;width:380px;background-color:rgb(231,242,249);\"> <h5><a name=\"Download_Installation\"> </a> <span style=\"font-size:130%;\">Download &amp; Installation </span></h5> The stencil library is available for <a href=\"http://billwscott.com/files/install_visio_wireframe_toolkit.zip\" target=\"_top\">download</a>. <ol><li> Make sure you have Microsoft Visio 2003 installed on your machine.  </li><li> Download the <a href=\"http://billwscott.com/files/install_visio_wireframe_toolkit.zip\" target=\"_top\">zip</a> file </li><li> Unzip this into your <em>C:My DocumentsMy Shapes folder</em>. (<em>My Shapes</em> should have been created by Visio when you installed it.) You should have the contents of the zip directly in the <em>My Shapes</em> folder.  </li></ol> <p> Now that it is installed, you can navigate to this directory and double-click inlineEditWireframeExample.vsd to experiment with the photo editing example.

I rarely need help in finding search terms based on four or five characters I have typed. Don't get me wrong, I think it is wonderful code, snappy response and perhaps has some purpose. I just have never found it personally useful. I mean if I am going to look up Tom Cruise, I perhaps might find it useful that it completes it for me and spells it correctly.

Did it really help me narrow on results or just distract me along the way. (Hey sometimes distraction is intended for a purpose-- don't see its value here.)<br /><br />If you have found Google Suggests useful please let me know. I am sure I am missing something. I would love to understand common use cases in which this is the case.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;\">Yahoo! Instant Search</span><br /><a href=\"http://instant.search.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo!'s Instant Search</a> takes a different twist on this. A balloon popup shows up with a single best match (based on Yahoo! Shortcuts). Kind of like a 'google suggests' for 'feeling lucky' only  your lucky day is on Yahoo!<br /><br />Typing 'tom cruise' yields the following:<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/20/71870546_d9482f83fe_o.png\" alt=\"yahoo-instant-tomcruise.png\" width=\"380\" /><br /><br />Ok, the difference here is a candidate result is shown based on what I have typed. But here are the caveats.<br /><ul>   <li>I have to type fairly specific, complete search terms. 'tom c' does not cut it. 'tom cruise' does. And do I really want the imdb database result for Tom? Interestingly, the Y! Shortcut is his fan page, which is what I was looking for in this case.</li>   <li>The balloon can be distracting since I am personally conditioned to multiple results to look at. Giving me just one seems to make me think harder about whether this is the right place to go. I tend to compare results before picking a term to drill into.</li>   <li>With the balloon in place, hitting enter just takes me to the results.

Perhaps if Google Suggests showed synonymous search terms around what I am trying to search for (hard problem) it might be more useful.<br /><br />It is interesting that the instant search provides a nice interface for those with screen readers. The popup triggers visibility and is read by the reader. Those without sight can know the best result found instantly. Nice side effect.<br /><br />Now I am on the fence overall about its narrowing capability vs. the distraction it causes me. For popular items it seems to have a 50/50 chance finding me exactly what I want. However, I tend to be someone who is searching for more obscure items so to me it is distracting (though cool!) The fact that it narrows to 1 item causes it to have this sharp distinction between distraction vs. narrowing.<br /><br />Do you like or not? If I understand correctly, it did well in user tests. What say ye?<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Kayak Auto Complete</span><br />Kayak.com is a good example of live auto complete. Say the user is wanting to fly into New York city. They seem to remember that the airport they want is called LaGuardia (not sure how to spell it or what the airport code is). When I type 'New Y' I get the following results:<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/34/71871872_e922cab3cc_o.png\" alt=\"kayak-auto-complete-LGA.png\" height=\"98\" width=\"303\" /><br /><br />Ok, this is nice. I hate remembering the airport code. And I hate having to go to another page to find out that the site could not figure out what I meant. Jakob Nielsen states as one of his ten usability principles, Error Prevention. Providing the feedback instantaneously to cue me to what the system thinks is great. Saves me time and makes me feel like I am narrowing in on the right thing. This probably ties in with Jared Spool's research on <a href=\"http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2005/10/20/brain-sparks-live-the-confidence-game-102705\">The Confidence Game</a> which shows that users are happy to click and click as long as they feel confident they are reaching their goal. Here I have the best of both worlds. Raise my confidence and do it with the minimal effort!<br /><br />Hey Travelocity, FareChase, Orbitz, Hotwire, Expedia-- this is good stuff! Get this feature in your sites!<br /><br />Without a question this helped me narrow to my result and did not distract me.<br /><br />Of course I have compared apples and oranges. Both Google &amp; Yahoo are dealing with an enormous body of information that it is trying to give you instantaneous feedback on during your typing. Much to infer. Kayak has an extremely limited (though hard to remember) set of data. Perfect for an instantaneous narrowing opportunity.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Yahoo! Mail &amp; Why it Dumped LiveSearch</span><br />The new Yahoo! Mail Beta (still in limited release--and no I can't get you in the beta! :-) has a nice search box for finding content in your mail. It works extremely well. When you search for some content you thought came into your mail messages, the results show snippets of the conversations with the matched text highlighted.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/34/71880233_9a73c74796_o.png\" alt=\"candygram-search-box.png\" height=\"102\" width=\"194\" /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/35/71880444_3f2ef49ff6_o.png\" alt=\"candygram-search-box-02.png\" height=\"102\" width=\"194\" /><br /><br />Now you will notice that the search box has a little \"Go\" button beside it (and when activated, the an inline progress indicator shows). So how can I call this live search? Well it really isn't. However, they started with a live search in the Alpha version. The user would type a few characters and then the search would trigger. However, when the product went beta they went with a more traditional \"submit\" model. In other words instead of key events (or losing focus) implicitly triggering a search, the user has to now hit the \"Go\" button to get a search initiated. Why the change?<br /><br />The primary reason was performance. Supporting the scale of users within the Yahoo! Mail network would be an enormous hit on servers. However, I think there is also something to be learned from this on the user experience side.<br /><br />Now this is not scientific. It is my observation. But when confronted with a live search box that will return results (not suggestions) I immediately expect a  button to trigger it. So at first I am a little unsure. Ok, that can be worked around by learning the interface. But next as I start to type a string, say \"liberty mutual\", it would start matching 'liber' finding things about liberals, liberality, liberty and so on. Now it starts changing as I continue to type. I get through the first word 'liberty' and now I find mail that discusses liberty in the U.S. and elsewhere as well as finding an email from my insurance company. Finally I type the whole thing in and get what I am looking for.<br /><br />Now here is the point. How helpful was the constant feedback loop?<br /><br />Did the feedback help me narrow to the message I am looking for or did it distract me during the task of entering what the term I knew I was going to type?<br /><br />I vote that it was distracting.<br /><br />I feel like I am in a race with the instantaneous search engine to get my term in before it starts returning the wrong results :-(<br /><br />Thankfully it was replaced by this more traditional (yet Ajax-based) solution.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Amazon Zuggests</span><br />Using the Amazon API, Francis Shanahan created a way (<a href=\"http://www.francisshanahan.com/zuggest.aspx\">Amazon Zuggests</a>) to search amazon using the similar approach of Google Suggests and Yahoo! Instant Search.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/35/71881783_b225c1b3da_o.png\" alt=\"LiveSearch-AmazonZuggest-03.png\" width=\"380\" /><br /><br />This is really nice since it shows the results to my search terms as I type. Since the results usually have cover thumbnails and some text, it is easy to use it to explore to find books on a topic without ever leaving the page.<br /><br />But does it really help me narrow quickly? Well, yes &amp; no. Since it seems to not try to search too fast (on my pausing to type) I don't get into the race I felt like in the early Y! Mail Alpha. I can type a word, say \"football.\" What I get back is a bunch of books on football for NFL and college. What I really want is college football. So I continue typing, adding the word \"college\". Now I get a bunch of college football results.<br /><br />By not narrowing too quickly (to one result as with Y! Instant Search) and not trying to return results to fast (like Y! Mail Alpha did), the feedback loop is nice and allows me to refine by typing keywords.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Summary or What I Think I Have Learned So Far</span><br /><ul></ul>To kind of sum of the lessons I think I see here. Live search is useful when<br /><ul><li>The results are <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">direct</span> results-- <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">not indirect</span> results (as is the case with Google Suggests)</li><li>The results are <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">narrowing and not diverging</span> (as in the case of showing more search terms in Google Suggests)<br /></li><li>The results are <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">narrowing and not distracting</span> (as was the case with Y! Mail Alpha, Google Suggests and potentially Y! Instant Search)<br /></li></ul>There are other ways to refine search. Nice examples on the Yahoo! site include the new Yahoo! Shopping and Yahoo! Travel which allow you to select &amp; unselect filters on the left and see the results on the right in real time. One of the early examples of this was on the kayak.com site in refining flight searches.<br /><br />So I am interested in feedback. What other general rules am I thinking of? What other examples come to mind? What do you like or hate about live search examples?<br /><br />Feedback appreciated.","html":"<p>Ajax opened the door to immediate actions. One of the first types of problems that immediate action was applied to was in the area of search. Here are a few examples.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;\">Google Suggest</span><br /><a href=\"http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&amp;hl=en\">Google Suggest</a> was an early demonstration of the concept of Live Search. As the user types in the Google search box, the top search terms that match the user's input are shown in a drop down. If I am looking for 'Tom Cruise' only 5 characters are required to match this search term ('tom c').<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/35/71870548_ba92acbf19_o.png\" alt=\"google-suggests-tomcruise.png\" width=\"380\" /><br /><br />I have never used Google Suggests for anything more than a demonstration of how live search works. I rarely need help in finding search terms based on four or five characters I have typed. Don't get me wrong, I think it is wonderful code, snappy response and perhaps has some purpose. I just have never found it personally useful. I mean if I am going to look up Tom Cruise, I perhaps might find it useful that it completes it for me and spells it correctly.

I will try to blog about some of the events as I observe them.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\">Creating Passionate Users</span><br />I attended <a href=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/\">Kathy Sierra</a>'s <a href=\"http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/7951\">workshop</a> this morning, <a href=\"http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/7951\">Creating Passionate Users</a>. Wow! What a treat.<br /><br />I went back over my notes and found it very hard to summarize what I had heard (since there were dozens of excellent thoughts to chew on.) But here are a few of the nuggets I came away with.<br /><ul><li>People want to \"kick ass\". As Cooper says, \"User's don't want to appear stupid.\" It's important that a person be able to move from the \"I suck\" phase in mastering anything to the \"I rock\" phase.<br /></li><li>Constant learning potential is the key to passion. The promise of mastery and its benefits along with continual stimulating nuances to a craft make for passion. It's nice to have a long growth potential.<br /></li><li>The brain has a crap filter. We have to speak to the BRAIN (physical, chemical responses that can't be help) rather than the mind. For it is in speaking to the way we are wired that we can get to the mind.</li><li>Conversation trumps formal lecture. The brain engages in a conversation. It goes into stasis in a lecture.</li><li>Do what it takes to get users past the \"I suck\" phase into the \"I rock\" phase. You can motivate users to do this by providing:</li><ul><li>a way to recognize expertise</li><li>a meaningul benefit</li><li>a clear path to getting there</li></ul><li>Learn from game design. The cycle of build interest -&gt; challenging activity -&gt; payoff.<br /></li><li>Learn from screenwriters. The heros journey.<br /></li><ul><li>Life is normal</li><li>Something happens to change that</li><li>[helpful sidekick shows up]</li><li>Things really suck</li><li>Hero overcomes bad things</li><li>Life returns to normal-- but the character is changed.</li></ul><li>Ask two questions when you are writing.</li><ul><li>What will be the user's journey?</li><li>How will the protaganist be changed.</li></ul><li>Dignity is deadly. Once you try to appease the critics you will be driven to mediocrity. If you are doing something write someone will criticize.</li></ul>And the final thought is when writing, designing a user experience, etc. it is not about you (the author, creator). It is about how users feel when they interact with your organization/book/blog, etc.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\">Ruby on Rails</span><br />And speaking of passion, I got to hear my friend <a class=\"l\" href=\"http://www.loudthinking.com/\">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> give a <a href=\"http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/7879\">workshop</a> on Ruby on Rails.<br /><br />I have loved this language and framework since the first time I played with it. I still do. I just wish I had some time to do something with it. Note to self-- make time!<br /><br />Lots could be said, but one thing that stuck out was the concept of \"partials\". In Rails you can  express snippets of HTML as partials (read templates). You then have access to this snippet to include in your code. Kind of like JSP tags only a thousand times lighter and in native HTML.<br /><br />You can also create rjs files (rails javascript). Its a way to create javascript with a ruby on rails syntax being able to access the DOM via rails variables or by selecting elements with CSS selectors. Then there are page manipulation mechanisms to apply animation effects or hide, show or replace html. What's cool is the code is generated on the server side in the controller where it is natural to think of accessing application state. It controls what gets generated on the client side in JavaScript land.<br /><br />There was also some interesting discussion of using Microformats as a data source. David is working on ways to transform a microformat into your application specific HTML markup. Interestingly I did a blog interview with a group from the UK along with <a href=\"http://www.technorati.com/about/staff.html?s=kevin_marks#kevin_marks\">Kevin Marks</a> of <a href=\"http://technorati.com\">Technorati</a> who is doing a lot of the work with microformats. We also talked about this over dinner. It is somewhat the argument for JSON. JSON expressess data. JSON is native to the browser. Microformat express data (albeit in XHTML). Microformats are native to the browser. So in both cases the load is light on parsing and using them to render views.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Bruce Sterling Keynote</span></span><br />On the Internet of Things. A look at the visionary world of when all things are acessible via the \"internet\". And by all things I mean all things. Like your keys or your shoes. Imagine, he says \"googling\" for your shoes :-)<br /><br />Its the first time I have heard Bruce talk. He is an amazing speaker. An incredible wordsmith.

I still do. I just wish I had some time to do something with it. Note to self-- make time!<br /><br />Lots could be said, but one thing that stuck out was the concept of \"partials\". In Rails you can  express snippets of HTML as partials (read templates). You then have access to this snippet to include in your code. Kind of like JSP tags only a thousand times lighter and in native HTML.<br /><br />You can also create rjs files (rails javascript). Its a way to create javascript with a ruby on rails syntax being able to access the DOM via rails variables or by selecting elements with CSS selectors. Then there are page manipulation mechanisms to apply animation effects or hide, show or replace html. What's cool is the code is generated on the server side in the controller where it is natural to think of accessing application state. It controls what gets generated on the client side in JavaScript land.<br /><br />There was also some interesting discussion of using Microformats as a data source. David is working on ways to transform a microformat into your application specific HTML markup. Interestingly I did a blog interview with a group from the UK along with <a href=\"http://www.technorati.com/about/staff.html?s=kevin_marks#kevin_marks\">Kevin Marks</a> of <a href=\"http://technorati.com\">Technorati</a> who is doing a lot of the work with microformats. We also talked about this over dinner. It is somewhat the argument for JSON. JSON expressess data. JSON is native to the browser. Microformat express data (albeit in XHTML). Microformats are native to the browser. So in both cases the load is light on parsing and using them to render views.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Bruce Sterling Keynote</span></span><br />On the Internet of Things. A look at the visionary world of when all things are acessible via the \"internet\". And by all things I mean all things. Like your keys or your shoes. Imagine, he says \"googling\" for your shoes :-)<br /><br />Its the first time I have heard Bruce talk. He is an amazing speaker. An incredible wordsmith. His approach to writing science fiction is to first write a visionary technology manifesto then craft a story around the emergence of the technology into the future.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Sites to Check Out/Books to Read</span></span><br />So here is the list of interesting things I want to investigate further:<br /><span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;\" id=\"formatbar_CreateLink\" title=\"Link\"></span><br />Books:<br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0060920432&amp;tag=looksgoodwork-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=looksgoodwork-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0060920432\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /></li><li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0596007795&amp;tag=looksgoodwork-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">Mind Hacks : Tips &amp; Tricks for Using Your Brain (Hacks)</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=looksgoodwork-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596007795\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /></li><li>Creating Passionate Users (coming summer 2006)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0385721706&amp;tag=looksgoodwork-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">The Wisdom of Crowds</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=looksgoodwork-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0385721706\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /></li><li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/157586052X&amp;tag=looksgoodwork-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">The Media Equation : How People Treat Computers, Television, and New Media like Real People and Places (CSLI Lecture Notes)</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=looksgoodwork-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=157586052X\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /></li><li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0262693267&amp;tag=looksgoodwork-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">Shaping Things (Mediaworks Pamphlets)</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=looksgoodwork-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0262693267\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /></li></ul><span class=\"down\" style=\"display:block;\" id=\"formatbar_CreateLink\" title=\"Link\"></span><br />Sites:<br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://eeggs.com\">eeggs.com</a></li><li><a href=\"http://gallery.ipodlounge.com/\">ipodlounge</a></li><li><a href=\"http://makezine.com/faire/\">Maker Faire</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/\">instructables</a></li><li><a href=\"http://secondlife.com/\">second life</a></li><li><a href=\"http://iconbuffet.com\">iconbuffet</a></li><li><a href=\"http://fluxiom.com\">fluxiom</a><br /></li></ul><br /><br />By the way, I will be giving a <a href=\"http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8602\">15 minute talk</a> to the conference about the Yahoo!

Prior to this they pointed to an incorrect version of the talk)</em><br /><br />I had prepared the speech on paper. However, my extemperanous nature took over and I gave the talk from the gut. But just for heck of it here is the full text of the prepared speech.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Written Form of the Talk (with the accompanying slide noted in brackets)</span><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[interactive language of attention]</span><br />I was very fortunate to attend Kathy Sierra's talk on Monday Morning -- Creating Passionate Users. So many nuggets I am still ruminating on. But one thought in particular is apropos to our talk today. The \"Power of a tribe\" Its really about thinking about who your tribe of passionate users will be around your product or services.<br /><br />Its not so much thinking about how to get their attention but how to foster a tribe. For once you have a tribe you have attention.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[attention. tribes pay attention.]</span><br />Tribe members pay attention to the tribe.<br /><br />I was also struck by the quick peek we had into the second Life tribes. Wasn't that an incredible story about the tax revolt. Second Lifers setting property on fire to protest taxation. And guess what? It got attention. And it changed the rules.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[tribal platform.]</span><br />Yesterday, I heard Jeffrey McManus who leads our Yahoo! Developer Network describe the suite of web services as a \"Participation Platform\". May I stretch it a bit and call it a tribal platform?<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[Yahoo! Developer Network.]</span><br />The Yahoo! Developer Network has been a shining example within Yahoo! (and we believe outside as well) of the importance of openness in this clamor for garnering the user's attention. It has been the backplane to our openness, sort of a canvas of openness on which we can express even more openness.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[internal tribes]</span><br />It has had a good social impact within Yahoo! Its platform of participation has created tribes within Yahoo! that are motivated to share and connect with tribes on the outside. And we have our tribe days too - called hack days. These internal mashup contests, the best Yahoo! Music Engine Plugin, the best Konfabulator (Yahoo! Widgets) day. These kind of tribe days captivate the imagination and attention of our best designers and developers.<br /><br />In fact a good example of this is just yesterday Chad Dickerson, Edward Ho, Jonathan Trevor, and Karon Weber unleashed CheckMates here at the conference. You can check it out at chaddickerson.com. Its really just a tribal sort of thing.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[two recent examples]</span><br />Well with all of this tribal goodness going on inside the halls of Yahoo! it just had to work its way out into the wild.<br /><br />Two very recent examples I would like to share is the release of the Yahoo! Design Pattern Library and the Yahoo! User Interface Library.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[design tribe]</span><br />So at Yahoo! I have two roles. One is as Ajax Evangelist. The other is the Design Pattern Shepherd. I am organizationally within User Experience. I am fortunate to work for the likes of Erin Malone and Larry Tesler. Both who believe strongly in the power of the tribe.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[design tribe. new models.]</span><br />Well, this last year has seen the rise of Ajax and the revival of JavaScript and Flash. We are no longer bound by the page refresh model. With this change, new user interaction idioms have surfaced on the web. The exciting thing about these new \"patterns of interaction\" is that they make it easier to create engaging interactions. And they also go a long way in making information relevant. Engaging interactions help get the user's attention. Relevant information goes a long way in keeping the user's attention.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[attention. engaging.]</span><br />Getting the user's attention is all about engagement. It's about creating a compelling reason for interest. It's about what we call the Wow! Factor. There are points in the user's interaction that are pure moments of opportunity. Opportunities for engagement. Opportunities for getting the user's attention. Moments for creating interest. Interesting moments.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[attention. relevant.]</span><br />But it's not just about getting the user's attention. It's also about keeping the user's attention. It's about creating relevancy -- creating more reasons for the user to stay interested. By having intelligence more near the user can experience a deeper delight with the interface. Not just an initial euphoric Wow!, but a deeper more satisfying delight.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[attention. loyalty.]</span><br />The final stage of all of this goodness is pure, unadulterated love. It's that \"sit around the campfire singing Kumba-ya\" kind of attitude. It is when attention turns into habit. The goodness of wow and delight blend together to create loyalty. The blending of engagement and relevancy.<br /><br />Now here is where as an Ajax Evangelist I would normally make an altar call to come to this Ajax goodness. But I am not going to claim that a little Ajax powder is going to guarantee you a slice of the user's attention. All I can say is that there are new ways of interaction. And these new ways of interaction create the possibility to be more engaging and more relevant.<br /><br />And that is what this design tribe is struggling with. How to communicate, design, document these rich interactions.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[immediate]</span><br />First, its about the immediacy of information, logic and presentation that can be brought near just in time. Ajax makes it possible to provide what is needed in the nick of time.<br /><br />What immediacy brings to the table is the ability to be relevant. No longer does information have to be stale. Patterns exist that illustrate how to bring information near. Relevant, just-in-time information is attention-getting &amp; keeping.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[direct]</span><br />And what about directness? If the user has to go through a lot of indirect steps to find information or accomplish their task, how long do you think you will hold their attention? But if you can provide direct editing, drag and drop and other desktop mechanisms the user may find themselves more confident and engaged in your site.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[inviting]</span><br />And how about the power of an invitation?<br />Nothing gets someone's attention more than offering an appropriate tip at just the right moment. And how about politeness? Doesn't that rank high on your attention meter? These patterns throw out the welcome mat. If done correctly, they provide relevant instruction just when you need it. Enticing the user to engage.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[without boundaries]</span><br />Want to lose the user's attention? How about erecting hurdles for them? How about making them jump unneccessarily from page to page and turn a simple process into a laborious one? That was the old model. It centered around page-to-page interaction. But these patterns bias staying in the page. They help keep the user engaged by not giving them a point to decide to bail out.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[light footprint]</span><br />Users will lose interest if tasks seem to hard. The newer styles of interaction center around keeping a light footprint. Making it easy for the user to interact.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[cinematic]</span><br />And don't forget animations (in measure). Transitions can communicate relationships. What has changed. Symmetry of action.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[rich in objects]</span><br />And finally, if all content has the same level of richness, what kind of interest will be created? Little or none! But take some content and turn it into an object. Now its bloggable, shareable, searchable. Rich Internet Objects like trip planner make it fun to create content. Similar work is being enabled by projects like microformats.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[pattern list]</span><br />This is just a few of the themes of interaction that have emerged recently on the web. And these are the patterns that make up much of these interactions you now see on the web.<br /><br />This study of what patterns were emerging on the web and what patterns were emerging across Yahoo! are being catalogued within the Yahoo! Design Pattern Library.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[pattern library]</span><br />Recently, 2/13, we released a public facing version of the Pattern Library. While it currently only has a handful of patterns in its initial release, we plan to fill out this library over the course of the year.<br /><br />Why? It's really about surfacing a vocabulary. It's about creating a language around getting and keeping the user's attention. It's about ways to create Wow, Delight &amp; Love.<br /><br />Every good tribe has a language. This is one dialect of the design tribe's language.<br /><br />So when you create a language connotations arise and metaphors and similes and double entendres arise.

I followed an incredible sweeping history of computing by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dyson_%28science_historian%29\">George Dyson</a>.<br /><br />I kept thinking, wow! how to follow someone like Mr. Dyson.<br /><br />But the talk seemed to be well received. Most importantly several folks really got excited about the vision that I was putting forth. In a nutshell, a pattern library becames a vocabulary for a tribe. It becomes a nesting place for exposing solutions to help create a passionate design &amp; development community.<br /><br />You can get the <a href=\"http://billwscott.com/files/eTech-2006-highorder-talk.pdf\">PDF</a> here (5 mb).

Prior to this they pointed to an incorrect version of the talk)</em><br /><br />I had prepared the speech on paper. However, my extemperanous nature took over and I gave the talk from the gut. But just for heck of it here is the full text of the prepared speech.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Written Form of the Talk (with the accompanying slide noted in brackets)</span><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[interactive language of attention]</span><br />I was very fortunate to attend Kathy Sierra's talk on Monday Morning -- Creating Passionate Users. So many nuggets I am still ruminating on. But one thought in particular is apropos to our talk today. The \"Power of a tribe\" Its really about thinking about who your tribe of passionate users will be around your product or services.<br /><br />Its not so much thinking about how to get their attention but how to foster a tribe. For once you have a tribe you have attention.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[attention. tribes pay attention.]</span><br />Tribe members pay attention to the tribe.<br /><br />I was also struck by the quick peek we had into the second Life tribes. Wasn't that an incredible story about the tax revolt. Second Lifers setting property on fire to protest taxation. And guess what? It got attention. And it changed the rules.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[tribal platform.]</span><br />Yesterday, I heard Jeffrey McManus who leads our Yahoo! Developer Network describe the suite of web services as a \"Participation Platform\". May I stretch it a bit and call it a tribal platform?<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[Yahoo! Developer Network.]</span><br />The Yahoo! Developer Network has been a shining example within Yahoo! (and we believe outside as well) of the importance of openness in this clamor for garnering the user's attention. It has been the backplane to our openness, sort of a canvas of openness on which we can express even more openness.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[internal tribes]</span><br />It has had a good social impact within Yahoo! Its platform of participation has created tribes within Yahoo! that are motivated to share and connect with tribes on the outside. And we have our tribe days too - called hack days. These internal mashup contests, the best Yahoo! Music Engine Plugin, the best Konfabulator (Yahoo! Widgets) day. These kind of tribe days captivate the imagination and attention of our best designers and developers.<br /><br />In fact a good example of this is just yesterday Chad Dickerson, Edward Ho, Jonathan Trevor, and Karon Weber unleashed CheckMates here at the conference. You can check it out at chaddickerson.com. Its really just a tribal sort of thing.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[two recent examples]</span><br />Well with all of this tribal goodness going on inside the halls of Yahoo! it just had to work its way out into the wild.<br /><br />Two very recent examples I would like to share is the release of the Yahoo! Design Pattern Library and the Yahoo! User Interface Library.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[design tribe]</span><br />So at Yahoo! I have two roles. One is as Ajax Evangelist. The other is the Design Pattern Shepherd. I am organizationally within User Experience. I am fortunate to work for the likes of Erin Malone and Larry Tesler. Both who believe strongly in the power of the tribe.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[design tribe. new models.]</span><br />Well, this last year has seen the rise of Ajax and the revival of JavaScript and Flash. We are no longer bound by the page refresh model. With this change, new user interaction idioms have surfaced on the web. The exciting thing about these new \"patterns of interaction\" is that they make it easier to create engaging interactions. And they also go a long way in making information relevant. Engaging interactions help get the user's attention. Relevant information goes a long way in keeping the user's attention.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[attention. engaging.]</span><br />Getting the user's attention is all about engagement. It's about creating a compelling reason for interest. It's about what we call the Wow! Factor. There are points in the user's interaction that are pure moments of opportunity. Opportunities for engagement. Opportunities for getting the user's attention. Moments for creating interest. Interesting moments.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[attention. relevant.]</span><br />But it's not just about getting the user's attention. It's also about keeping the user's attention. It's about creating relevancy -- creating more reasons for the user to stay interested. By having intelligence more near the user can experience a deeper delight with the interface. Not just an initial euphoric Wow!, but a deeper more satisfying delight.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[attention. loyalty.]</span><br />The final stage of all of this goodness is pure, unadulterated love. It's that \"sit around the campfire singing Kumba-ya\" kind of attitude. It is when attention turns into habit. The goodness of wow and delight blend together to create loyalty. The blending of engagement and relevancy.<br /><br />Now here is where as an Ajax Evangelist I would normally make an altar call to come to this Ajax goodness. But I am not going to claim that a little Ajax powder is going to guarantee you a slice of the user's attention. All I can say is that there are new ways of interaction. And these new ways of interaction create the possibility to be more engaging and more relevant.<br /><br />And that is what this design tribe is struggling with. How to communicate, design, document these rich interactions.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[immediate]</span><br />First, its about the immediacy of information, logic and presentation that can be brought near just in time. Ajax makes it possible to provide what is needed in the nick of time.<br /><br />What immediacy brings to the table is the ability to be relevant. No longer does information have to be stale. Patterns exist that illustrate how to bring information near. Relevant, just-in-time information is attention-getting &amp; keeping.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[direct]</span><br />And what about directness? If the user has to go through a lot of indirect steps to find information or accomplish their task, how long do you think you will hold their attention? But if you can provide direct editing, drag and drop and other desktop mechanisms the user may find themselves more confident and engaged in your site.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[inviting]</span><br />And how about the power of an invitation?<br />Nothing gets someone's attention more than offering an appropriate tip at just the right moment. And how about politeness? Doesn't that rank high on your attention meter? These patterns throw out the welcome mat. If done correctly, they provide relevant instruction just when you need it. Enticing the user to engage.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[without boundaries]</span><br />Want to lose the user's attention? How about erecting hurdles for them? How about making them jump unneccessarily from page to page and turn a simple process into a laborious one? That was the old model. It centered around page-to-page interaction. But these patterns bias staying in the page. They help keep the user engaged by not giving them a point to decide to bail out.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[light footprint]</span><br />Users will lose interest if tasks seem to hard. The newer styles of interaction center around keeping a light footprint. Making it easy for the user to interact.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[cinematic]</span><br />And don't forget animations (in measure). Transitions can communicate relationships. What has changed. Symmetry of action.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[rich in objects]</span><br />And finally, if all content has the same level of richness, what kind of interest will be created? Little or none! But take some content and turn it into an object. Now its bloggable, shareable, searchable. Rich Internet Objects like trip planner make it fun to create content. Similar work is being enabled by projects like microformats.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[pattern list]</span><br />This is just a few of the themes of interaction that have emerged recently on the web. And these are the patterns that make up much of these interactions you now see on the web.<br /><br />This study of what patterns were emerging on the web and what patterns were emerging across Yahoo! are being catalogued within the Yahoo! Design Pattern Library.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">[pattern library]</span><br />Recently, 2/13, we released a public facing version of the Pattern Library. While it currently only has a handful of patterns in its initial release, we plan to fill out this library over the course of the year.<br /><br />Why? It's really about surfacing a vocabulary. It's about creating a language around getting and keeping the user's attention. It's about ways to create Wow, Delight &amp; Love.<br /><br />Every good tribe has a language. This is one dialect of the design tribe's language.<br /><br />So when you create a language connotations arise and metaphors and similes and double entendres arise. Lots of various birds come to roost here.<br /><br />So its also about creating a nesting place for all of the other ideas that surround design solutions. It's about understanding and discussion the context of a problem. When to use a pattern. How to use a pattern. And the rationale. But it's even broader. By having a library, a language we can talk about getting and keeping user's with special needs. We can consider accessibility concerns. We can consider internationalization issues. Issues with degradability. All the things that affect getting and keeping the user's attention.<br /><br />And even more exciting from its branches we can hang the fruit of code.

I quickly added it to my Amazon wish list. However the next day at O'Reilly's booth they were giving away books. I could only choose one-- guess what they had-- that's right, Mind Hacks.<br /><br />Mind Hacks is all <a href=\"http://www.mindhacks.com/\">about</a> short experiments or hacks you can do to discover how your brain is really working. There are 100 hacks. For example, hack #59 discusses how we actually hear with our eyes (you can check out the <a href=\"http://www.media.uio.no/personer/arntm/McGurk_english.html\">McGurk Effect</a> for yourself). Or try #65 which explains <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Why Can't You Tickle Yourself?</span> And goes on to describe how to build a self-tickling machine.<br /><br />But the hack that really got my attention (no pun intended) was hack #37 <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Grab Attention</span>.<br /><br /><blockquote><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Sudden movement or light can grab your attention, thanks to a second region for visual processing.</span></blockquote><br />It turns out that besides our normal visual processing region of the brain (you are using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_lobe\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">occipital lobe</span></a> right now while reading this blog) there is a second region that deals with attention capture.<br /><br />We experience it everyday. While talking with a friend at a park someone throws a frisbee to another person in the background. Without trying you notice this change of motion even though you are not looking directly at it. You can thank the <a href=\"http://www.wayfinding.net/collicul.htm\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">superior colliculus</span></a> for this little attention interruption.<br /><br />As the authors describe it <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_colliculus\">this region</a> of the brain is not very sophisticated. But it does a good job of telling you to pay attention because something may be coming at you. You aren't sure what it is but you had better pay attention to it.<br /><br />One of the next set of <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns\">patterns</a> I am working on getting out the door at Yahoo! covers the idea of <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Transitions</span> (also known as animated effects or cinematic effects.) The connection between hack #37 and its application to transitions was immediately obvious. This is one of the reasons that moving something on the screen or causing it to fade or rapidly show up can get the attention of the user so readily.<br /><br />So this fed into my thinking, \"how do I use transitions for good and not for evil?\" How do I use transitions to communicate the correct intention to the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">superior colliculus</span>? As Kathy Sierra likes to say, \"Learn to speak to the BRAIN, not to the MIND.\"<br /><br />So a few days passed after reading this. I was starting to write up the rationale for the parent Transition pattern using the research cited in the Mind Hacks book. While doing some more research I stumbled across an <a href=\"http://24ways.org/advent/introduction-to-scriptaculous-effects\">article</a> on <a href=\"http://24ways.org/\">24ways</a> that discussed the transition effects in the <a href=\"http://script.aculo.us/\">Scriptaculous</a> library. At the beginning of his article, <a href=\"http://binarybonsai.com/about/\"><span class=\"fn\">Michael Heilemann</span></a> writes:<br /><blockquote><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">...let me just take a moment to explain how I came to see smooth transitions as something more than smoke and mirror-like effects included for with little more motive than to dazzle and make parents go ‘uuh, snazzy’.<br /><br />Earlier this year, I had the good fortune of meeting the kind, gentle and quite knowledgable Matt Webb at a conference here in Copenhagen where we were both speaking (though I will be the first to admit my little talk on Open Source Design was vastly inferior to Matt’s talk). Matt held a talk called Fixing Broken Windows (based on the Broken Windows theory), which really made an impression on me, and which I have since then referred back to several times.<br /><br />You can listen to it yourself, as it’s available from <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/download/Reboot70HallAspeakerssaturday/9.Matt_Webb.mp4\">Archive.org</a>. Though since Matt’s session uses many visual examples, you’ll have to rely on your imagination for some of the examples he runs through during it. Also, I think it looses audio for a few seconds every once in a while.<br /><br />Anyway, one of the things Matt talked a lot about, was how our eyes are wired to react to movement. The world doesn’t flickr. It doesn’t disappear or suddenly change and force us to look for the change. Things move smoothly in the real world. They do not pop up.</span></blockquote>Turns out that <a href=\"http://interconnected.org/home/\">Matt Webb</a> is one of the authors (along with <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/catalog/view/au/1932\">Tom Stafford</a>) of Mind Hacks (duh!) Well that made sense. I listened to his talk and got very excited. I had been writing and talking about how to use and not abuse these effects on the web. Matt's talk and his writing in the Hack book (and <a href=\"http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/attention/index.html\">other articles</a> online) finally gave me solid grounding for those propositions.<br /><br />A couple of examples stand out from the Broken Windows talk.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dodging the Apple Widgets</span><br />Matt pointed out the odd effect used to dismiss the Apple Mac OS X Widgets. Instead of going away from you when dismissed, instead they fly out at you and fade out. The effect is as if the widgets are coming straight at you (like a star field) and whiz right by your head. Matt's point is that the action is \"put the widgets away\" but the effect communicates \"look out their are flying widgets that are about to hit me.\" The action is for them to diminish in importance. However the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">superior colliculus</span> is screaming \"incoming-incoming-look out!\".<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What Just Happened?</span><br /><div style=\"margin-right:8px;margin-top:20px;float:left;\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/34/120057622_7b97494cbd_t.jpg\" alt=\"Zeitgeist\" /></div><br /><div>The second example is the Flickr Daily Zeitgeist a blog sidebar plugin (Matt discusses this <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2004/12/06/mndhcks_1.html\">in detail here</a>). When new photos show up they fade slowly in place overlaying four photos within the tile of photos. Not bad. You may or may not notice the photo showing up but that's ok. Its very secondary. However when it goes away it rapidly scales down revealing the images underneath while replacing one of the four images. The sudden rapid movement once again gets the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">superior colliculus</span> to say \"What the...\" You look and by the time you glance you are not really sure what happened.</div><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">How the Real World Works</span><br />Matt also makes the same observation that I have discussed before. That real world objects don't just pop in and pop out, appearing and disappearing suddenly. We usually see them go away or go somewhere in particular. By creating an online space that never behaves this way it makes for a more brain-intensive experience in trying to determine \"what just happened.\"<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Few Transitions</span><br />Just so we are all on the same page, here are some of the transitions that are being reviewed for the <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns\">Yahoo! Design Pattern Library</a>:<br /><ul><li>Brighten. Raise the luminosity or opacity of an object. Used to call attention to an area. The opposite of dim.<br /></li><li>Dim. Lower luminosity or opacity of an object.<br /></li><li>Expand. Animate an object growing.<br /></li><li>Collapse. Animate an object shrinking.<br /></li><li>Slide. Show an object move out from another object while being attached to that object.<br /></li><li>Self-Healing. Once an object is removed from an area a hole is left. Once the object is placed elsewhere the hole seals up, effectively healing itself.<br /></li><li>Animate. Simply animating position.<br /></li><li>Fade In. Cause an object to appear by fading in the object's opacity.<br /></li><li>Fade Out. Cause an object to disappear by fading out the object's opacity. Often the Self-Healing transition is used to close the hole left by the object.<br /></li><li>Spotlight. Usually used to momentarily highlight a region that has changed. The highlight is often combined with a Fade Out to create a <a href=\"http://ajaxpatterns.org/One-Second_Spotlight\">One-Second Spotlight</a> pattern.<br /></li></ul><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What Transitions Communicate</span><br />To me the key thing that any interface must do is communicate clearly and effectively.<br /><br />Transitional effects should communicate the state of the interface or the actions that have just taken place.<br /><ul><li>If an object fades away we know it changed state from visible to invisible even if we are not staring directly at the object.</li><li>If an object fades into view then we know the object has arrived. It was not there but now is here.</li><li>If an object fades rapidly it is seen as more important. If it fades slowly its importance is lower.</li><li>If an object is coming at us (getting larger and appearing to go past us) then we think of it as something that is important (and dangerous).</li><li>If an object zooms down in size rapidly and disappears it will capture the user's attention immediately. However if the object was not in the user's immediate focus (user was not directly manipulating the object) they will glance to see the change but may not even be able to tell what object went away.</li></ul><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Purpose of Transitions</span><br />First, they are primarily for <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">communication</span>. Keep in mind that transitions reinforce communication.  Having said that, it is important that the goal of communication be kept in mind regarding any transition effects.<br /><br />Second they can be used for <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">engagement</span>.<br />Interacting with an area on the screen that responds by slightly growing or seeing an accordion pane \"snap\" into place creates a slightly richer and compelling experience. The interface seems more alive. Of course going slightly overboard can be the equivalent of blink for Web 2.0 (blink 2.0?)<br /><br />One can imagine situations such as in games where engagement can take a more important role. However, in most web sites, communication is the most important purpose for transitions with engagement being second.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Guidelines for Transition Effects</span><br />From the discussion above we can extract some general principles for transitional effects.<br /><br />1) The more rapid the change the more important the event.<br />2) Rapid movement is seen as more important than rapid color change.<br />3) Movement toward the user is seen as more important than movement away from the user.<br />4) Very slow change can be processed without disrupting the user's attention.<br />5) Movement can be used to communicate where an object's new home is. By seeing the object moving from one place to another we understand where it went and therefore will be able to locate the object in the future.<br />6) Transitions should normally be reflexive. If an object moved and collapsed to a new spot, you should be able to open it and see it open up with the reverse transition. If you delete an object and it fades, then if you create an object it should fade into place. This creates a concept of <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">symmetry of action</span>.<br /><br />I would love to have feedback on what you think are the proper usages for these kinds of transitions.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/ajax\" rel=\"tag\">ajax</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/design\" rel=\"tag\">design</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/patterns\" rel=\"tag\">patterns</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/design+patterns\" rel=\"tag\">design patterns</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/ria\" rel=\"tag\">ria</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/user+experience\" rel=\"tag\">user+experience</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/interaction+design\" rel=\"tag\">interaction design</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/scriptaculous\" rel=\"tag\">scriptaculous</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/ypatterns\" rel=\"tag\">ypatterns</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/billscott\" rel=\"tag\">billscott</a></span>","html":"<p>When I attended <a href=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/\">Kathy Sierra</a>'s <a href=\"http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/7951\">workshop</a> on Creating Passionate Users, she mentioned the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0596007795&amp;tag=looksgoodwork-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">Mind Hacks</a>.

While doing some more research I stumbled across an <a href=\"http://24ways.org/advent/introduction-to-scriptaculous-effects\">article</a> on <a href=\"http://24ways.org/\">24ways</a> that discussed the transition effects in the <a href=\"http://script.aculo.us/\">Scriptaculous</a> library. At the beginning of his article, <a href=\"http://binarybonsai.com/about/\"><span class=\"fn\">Michael Heilemann</span></a> writes:<br /><blockquote><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">...let me just take a moment to explain how I came to see smooth transitions as something more than smoke and mirror-like effects included for with little more motive than to dazzle and make parents go ‘uuh, snazzy’.<br /><br />Earlier this year, I had the good fortune of meeting the kind, gentle and quite knowledgable Matt Webb at a conference here in Copenhagen where we were both speaking (though I will be the first to admit my little talk on Open Source Design was vastly inferior to Matt’s talk). Matt held a talk called Fixing Broken Windows (based on the Broken Windows theory), which really made an impression on me, and which I have since then referred back to several times.<br /><br />You can listen to it yourself, as it’s available from <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/download/Reboot70HallAspeakerssaturday/9.Matt_Webb.mp4\">Archive.org</a>. Though since Matt’s session uses many visual examples, you’ll have to rely on your imagination for some of the examples he runs through during it. Also, I think it looses audio for a few seconds every once in a while.<br /><br />Anyway, one of the things Matt talked a lot about, was how our eyes are wired to react to movement. The world doesn’t flickr. It doesn’t disappear or suddenly change and force us to look for the change. Things move smoothly in the real world. They do not pop up.</span></blockquote>Turns out that <a href=\"http://interconnected.org/home/\">Matt Webb</a> is one of the authors (along with <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/catalog/view/au/1932\">Tom Stafford</a>) of Mind Hacks (duh!) Well that made sense. I listened to his talk and got very excited. I had been writing and talking about how to use and not abuse these effects on the web. Matt's talk and his writing in the Hack book (and <a href=\"http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/attention/index.html\">other articles</a> online) finally gave me solid grounding for those propositions.<br /><br />A couple of examples stand out from the Broken Windows talk.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dodging the Apple Widgets</span><br />Matt pointed out the odd effect used to dismiss the Apple Mac OS X Widgets. Instead of going away from you when dismissed, instead they fly out at you and fade out. The effect is as if the widgets are coming straight at you (like a star field) and whiz right by your head. Matt's point is that the action is \"put the widgets away\" but the effect communicates \"look out their are flying widgets that are about to hit me.\" The action is for them to diminish in importance. However the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">superior colliculus</span> is screaming \"incoming-incoming-look out!\".<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What Just Happened?</span><br /><div style=\"margin-right:8px;margin-top:20px;float:left;\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/34/120057622_7b97494cbd_t.jpg\" alt=\"Zeitgeist\" /></div><br /><div>The second example is the Flickr Daily Zeitgeist a blog sidebar plugin (Matt discusses this <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2004/12/06/mndhcks_1.html\">in detail here</a>). When new photos show up they fade slowly in place overlaying four photos within the tile of photos. Not bad. You may or may not notice the photo showing up but that's ok. Its very secondary. However when it goes away it rapidly scales down revealing the images underneath while replacing one of the four images. The sudden rapid movement once again gets the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">superior colliculus</span> to say \"What the...\" You look and by the time you glance you are not really sure what happened.</div><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">How the Real World Works</span><br />Matt also makes the same observation that I have discussed before. That real world objects don't just pop in and pop out, appearing and disappearing suddenly. We usually see them go away or go somewhere in particular. By creating an online space that never behaves this way it makes for a more brain-intensive experience in trying to determine \"what just happened.\"<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Few Transitions</span><br />Just so we are all on the same page, here are some of the transitions that are being reviewed for the <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns\">Yahoo! Design Pattern Library</a>:<br /><ul><li>Brighten. Raise the luminosity or opacity of an object. Used to call attention to an area. The opposite of dim.<br /></li><li>Dim. Lower luminosity or opacity of an object.<br /></li><li>Expand. Animate an object growing.<br /></li><li>Collapse. Animate an object shrinking.<br /></li><li>Slide. Show an object move out from another object while being attached to that object.<br /></li><li>Self-Healing. Once an object is removed from an area a hole is left. Once the object is placed elsewhere the hole seals up, effectively healing itself.<br /></li><li>Animate. Simply animating position.<br /></li><li>Fade In. Cause an object to appear by fading in the object's opacity.<br /></li><li>Fade Out. Cause an object to disappear by fading out the object's opacity. Often the Self-Healing transition is used to close the hole left by the object.<br /></li><li>Spotlight. Usually used to momentarily highlight a region that has changed. The highlight is often combined with a Fade Out to create a <a href=\"http://ajaxpatterns.org/One-Second_Spotlight\">One-Second Spotlight</a> pattern.<br /></li></ul><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What Transitions Communicate</span><br />To me the key thing that any interface must do is communicate clearly and effectively.<br /><br />Transitional effects should communicate the state of the interface or the actions that have just taken place.<br /><ul><li>If an object fades away we know it changed state from visible to invisible even if we are not staring directly at the object.</li><li>If an object fades into view then we know the object has arrived. It was not there but now is here.</li><li>If an object fades rapidly it is seen as more important. If it fades slowly its importance is lower.</li><li>If an object is coming at us (getting larger and appearing to go past us) then we think of it as something that is important (and dangerous).</li><li>If an object zooms down in size rapidly and disappears it will capture the user's attention immediately. However if the object was not in the user's immediate focus (user was not directly manipulating the object) they will glance to see the change but may not even be able to tell what object went away.</li></ul><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Purpose of Transitions</span><br />First, they are primarily for <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">communication</span>. Keep in mind that transitions reinforce communication.  Having said that, it is important that the goal of communication be kept in mind regarding any transition effects.<br /><br />Second they can be used for <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">engagement</span>.<br />Interacting with an area on the screen that responds by slightly growing or seeing an accordion pane \"snap\" into place creates a slightly richer and compelling experience. The interface seems more alive. Of course going slightly overboard can be the equivalent of blink for Web 2.0 (blink 2.0?)<br /><br />One can imagine situations such as in games where engagement can take a more important role. However, in most web sites, communication is the most important purpose for transitions with engagement being second.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Guidelines for Transition Effects</span><br />From the discussion above we can extract some general principles for transitional effects.<br /><br />1) The more rapid the change the more important the event.<br />2) Rapid movement is seen as more important than rapid color change.<br />3) Movement toward the user is seen as more important than movement away from the user.<br />4) Very slow change can be processed without disrupting the user's attention.<br />5) Movement can be used to communicate where an object's new home is. By seeing the object moving from one place to another we understand where it went and therefore will be able to locate the object in the future.<br />6) Transitions should normally be reflexive. If an object moved and collapsed to a new spot, you should be able to open it and see it open up with the reverse transition. If you delete an object and it fades, then if you create an object it should fade into place. This creates a concept of <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">symmetry of action</span>.<br /><br />I would love to have feedback on what you think are the proper usages for these kinds of transitions.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/ajax\" rel=\"tag\">ajax</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/design\" rel=\"tag\">design</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/patterns\" rel=\"tag\">patterns</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/design+patterns\" rel=\"tag\">design patterns</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/ria\" rel=\"tag\">ria</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/user+experience\" rel=\"tag\">user+experience</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/interaction+design\" rel=\"tag\">interaction design</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/scriptaculous\" rel=\"tag\">scriptaculous</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/ypatterns\" rel=\"tag\">ypatterns</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/billscott\" rel=\"tag\">billscott</a></span></p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2013-12-24T03:12:50.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2013-12-24T03:12:50.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2006-03-31T01:26:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":43,"uuid":"a53408af-cfde-41de-bfe3-cb03b260f201","title":"Designing for Ajax - Presentation","slug":"designing-for-ajax-presentation","markdown":"Recently I have been giving a talk on <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Designing for Ajax</span>.

UI Library Example","slug":"carousel-component-y-ui-library-example","markdown":"Ok, so I have been extremely, extremely remiss in writing up what has been rattling around in my brain lately. So I have some pretty good excuses (lots of talks, lots of work, writing for the yui blog, writing various articles, lots of family visiting and so on.) But I have always felt that it was better to share something on this blog when I felt like I had something worthwhile to say (or share.)<br /><br />So just a week back I took on a weekend 'geek' project. For a project at work we needed a carousel style component. Here is an example:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://billwscott.com/carousel\"><img src=\"http://billwscott.com/carousel/images/carousel-screenshot_example.png\" alt=\"carousel example\" /></a><br /><br />I started on a Friday morning and was essentially finished on Sunday night. Although I will confess that I have tinkered with it on and off over the last week or so.<br /><br />I think this component is fairly flexible and does a good job of illustrating how to write a component for the <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui\">Yahoo! User Interface</a> library.<br /><br />I was going to wait and write up an article explaining how the component is built.

So I have some pretty good excuses (lots of talks, lots of work, writing for the yui blog, writing various articles, lots of family visiting and so on.) But I have always felt that it was better to share something on this blog when I felt like I had something worthwhile to say (or share.)<br /><br />So just a week back I took on a weekend 'geek' project. For a project at work we needed a carousel style component. Here is an example:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://billwscott.com/carousel\"><img src=\"http://billwscott.com/carousel/images/carousel-screenshot_example.png\" alt=\"carousel example\" /></a><br /><br />I started on a Friday morning and was essentially finished on Sunday night. Although I will confess that I have tinkered with it on and off over the last week or so.<br /><br />I think this component is fairly flexible and does a good job of illustrating how to write a component for the <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui\">Yahoo! User Interface</a> library.<br /><br />I was going to wait and write up an article explaining how the component is built. But until I can get that post together, I will point you to the component and the documentation I have already put together for it.<br /><br />It's not finished.

Foo Camp is a loosely organized gathering of folks that O'Reilly invites to flock together for a weekend of discussions, impromptu sessions, etc. Obviously a lot of interesting people (writer/producer of MacGyver series, engineering creator of the Osborne Computer, flickr folks, Jeff Bezos of Amazon fame, and so on...).<br /><br />One of the interesting talks that I attended was on the <a href=\"http://www.storycardtheater.com/index.html\">Japanese Storycard Theater</a>. <a href=\"http://www.batmosphere.com/\">Dave Battino</a> billed it as <em>PowerPoint for People</em>.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://billwscott.com/files/jp-story-theater-announce.jpg\" /><br /><br />It's based on traditional Japanese picture-card dramas called <a href=\"http://www.kamishibai.com/background.htm\">kamishibai</a> (paper theater).<br /><blockquote>Today's kamishibai has evolved from a form of street-storytelling which was popular throughout Japan from the 1920's into the 1950's.<br /><br />The kamishibai storyteller was also a candy seller. Riding a bicycle equipped with a small stage for showing the story cards, he would enter a village or neighborhood, dismount and loudly strike together two wooden clappers or allow a lucky child to do so. The sound was a signal for children to run from their homes and gather around him for story time. Those who bought candy got to stand nearest to the stage. Then, in a dramatic manner, he would start to tell 2-3 kamishibai episodes. He would not tell the whole story! The stories were told as continuing serials, that is, he would always stop at an exciting moment, leaving the children impatient for his next visit.<br /><br />From: <cite>http://www.kamishibai.com/background.htm</cite><br /></blockquote><br />The idea is really simple. A story is a simple stack of large illustrated story cards. The stack is presented so that the front card facing the audience is the current place in the story. On the back of the last card of the deck is the dialog for the illustration on the front card.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.storycardtheater.com/use.html\">Really simple idea</a>. Instead of having to twist your neck to read the text, you simply glance down at the dialog and a miniture version of the illustration. The trick is placing the dialog at the correct location in the deck instead of directly on the back of the card it goes with.<br /><br />Why is this important?<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Power of Engagement</span><br />It allows you the storyteller to stay engaged with the user. <em>Making eyes with the audience</em> is a powerful principle. Think of how many times you have seen a presentation (I have done it many times myself) where the presenter is constantly twisting their neck or turning their back to the audience to see the presentation. It's easy to lose interest while their back is turned. Watching kids respond to a kamishibai presentation versus a typical library book reading lets you see the benefit of this approach. Kamishibai keeps the kids attention, may book readings lose the attention as the reader cranes their neck to read the story. With kamishibai, the storyteller can concentrate on the drama-- the story instead of the technology.<br /><br />In the world of conference speaking some of the problem is in the very way that conference presentation technology is arranged. Singers have long employed speaker technology arranged in front of them (monitors) that allow the singer to hear themselves and therefore perform more confidently. This would be a nice addition for presentations. Projecting the same material along the back of the auditorium would allow presenters to always face their audience and receive the assurance that the right material is being displayed, timing their talk with the material (this is done in some venues, but rare at conferences.)<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Beauty of Simplicity</span><br />Now I use a lot of technology in my presentations. I employ embedded movies and animation. I like this. And based on feedback, others have enjoyed this approach. But there is an argument to be made for simple presentations. Dick Hardt of Sxip Identity has a wonderfully simple presentation called <a href=\"http://www.identity20.com/media/ETECH_2006/\">Who's the Dick on My Site</a>. It just employs single words or phrases that are perfectly timed with his talk. During the talk, Dick does not look at his presentation. He simply talks and the presentation reinforces his story.<br /><br />I work with Karon Weber a designer at Yahoo! (formerly of <a href=\"http://hci.stanford.edu/cs547/abstracts/01-02/020405-weber.html\">Pixar</a>). One of the techniques that Karon has employed in presenting her designs at Yahoo! is to use large (and I mean large, at least 4'x6') poster boards each telling part of the story. Instead of wireframes locked inside a computer, they are set free in this large format. In our current <em>war room</em> for a product we are working on it is fully decorated with these large poster boards. It of course does not dispense with the electronic (they are the source for the poster boards), but it makes the presentation of these ideas completely accessible to anyone who walks into the room (or hallway).<br /><br />The beauty of this approach is that it is highly practical and completely simple. It is focused on telling a story. It is in the spirit of Kamishibai.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Power of Good Transitions</span><br />When Dave Battino told us a story in the Foo class, I really enjoyed how he transitioned between cards in the story. If there was a quick sequence of action, he would rapidly switch the card. If the hero was in trouble and he wanted to build suspense he would slowly...drag...change...cards... Sometimes the slide was left to right, sometimes it was over the top. But it was effective. How many presenters have gotten enamoured with transitions between their slides and pulled out all of the stops. \"Hey, it's in Powerpoint, why should I use the fizzling, spiraling, flipping effect??\" Yet, with just a quick flip or a slow drag, the story was enhanced in the kamishibai method--not the emphasis. In my talks on cinematic effects I have talked a lot about the temptation to over emphasize these effects. Making transitions too slow, too long, too vivid, etc. I have often advocated the \"cut in half\" rule I learned from a member of the Motion Graphics community...<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Take the effect, transition, luminence change you have enstated and cut the effect in half. </span><br /><br />Transitions are for enhanced communication and engagement... Not for the sake of the effect alone.<br /><br />Happy Story Telling!","html":"<p>Back in the summer I had the opportunity to attend <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp\">Foo Camp '06</a> at the O'Reilly offices in Sebastapol, CA.

The sound was a signal for children to run from their homes and gather around him for story time. Those who bought candy got to stand nearest to the stage. Then, in a dramatic manner, he would start to tell 2-3 kamishibai episodes. He would not tell the whole story! The stories were told as continuing serials, that is, he would always stop at an exciting moment, leaving the children impatient for his next visit.<br /><br />From: <cite><a href='http://www.kamishibai.com/background.htm'>http://www.kamishibai.com/background.htm</a></cite><br /></blockquote><br />The idea is really simple. A story is a simple stack of large illustrated story cards. The stack is presented so that the front card facing the audience is the current place in the story. On the back of the last card of the deck is the dialog for the illustration on the front card.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.storycardtheater.com/use.html\">Really simple idea</a>. Instead of having to twist your neck to read the text, you simply glance down at the dialog and a miniture version of the illustration. The trick is placing the dialog at the correct location in the deck instead of directly on the back of the card it goes with.<br /><br />Why is this important?<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Power of Engagement</span><br />It allows you the storyteller to stay engaged with the user. <em>Making eyes with the audience</em> is a powerful principle. Think of how many times you have seen a presentation (I have done it many times myself) where the presenter is constantly twisting their neck or turning their back to the audience to see the presentation. It's easy to lose interest while their back is turned. Watching kids respond to a kamishibai presentation versus a typical library book reading lets you see the benefit of this approach. Kamishibai keeps the kids attention, may book readings lose the attention as the reader cranes their neck to read the story. With kamishibai, the storyteller can concentrate on the drama-- the story instead of the technology.<br /><br />In the world of conference speaking some of the problem is in the very way that conference presentation technology is arranged. Singers have long employed speaker technology arranged in front of them (monitors) that allow the singer to hear themselves and therefore perform more confidently. This would be a nice addition for presentations. Projecting the same material along the back of the auditorium would allow presenters to always face their audience and receive the assurance that the right material is being displayed, timing their talk with the material (this is done in some venues, but rare at conferences.)<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Beauty of Simplicity</span><br />Now I use a lot of technology in my presentations. I employ embedded movies and animation. I like this. And based on feedback, others have enjoyed this approach. But there is an argument to be made for simple presentations. Dick Hardt of Sxip Identity has a wonderfully simple presentation called <a href=\"http://www.identity20.com/media/ETECH_2006/\">Who's the Dick on My Site</a>. It just employs single words or phrases that are perfectly timed with his talk. During the talk, Dick does not look at his presentation. He simply talks and the presentation reinforces his story.<br /><br />I work with Karon Weber a designer at Yahoo! (formerly of <a href=\"http://hci.stanford.edu/cs547/abstracts/01-02/020405-weber.html\">Pixar</a>). One of the techniques that Karon has employed in presenting her designs at Yahoo! is to use large (and I mean large, at least 4'x6') poster boards each telling part of the story. Instead of wireframes locked inside a computer, they are set free in this large format. In our current <em>war room</em> for a product we are working on it is fully decorated with these large poster boards. It of course does not dispense with the electronic (they are the source for the poster boards), but it makes the presentation of these ideas completely accessible to anyone who walks into the room (or hallway).<br /><br />The beauty of this approach is that it is highly practical and completely simple. It is focused on telling a story. It is in the spirit of Kamishibai.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Power of Good Transitions</span><br />When Dave Battino told us a story in the Foo class, I really enjoyed how he transitioned between cards in the story. If there was a quick sequence of action, he would rapidly switch the card. If the hero was in trouble and he wanted to build suspense he would slowly...drag...change...cards... Sometimes the slide was left to right, sometimes it was over the top. But it was effective. How many presenters have gotten enamoured with transitions between their slides and pulled out all of the stops. \"Hey, it's in Powerpoint, why should I use the fizzling, spiraling, flipping effect??\" Yet, with just a quick flip or a slow drag, the story was enhanced in the kamishibai method--not the emphasis. In my talks on cinematic effects I have talked a lot about the temptation to over emphasize these effects. Making transitions too slow, too long, too vivid, etc. I have often advocated the \"cut in half\" rule I learned from a member of the Motion Graphics community...<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Take the effect, transition, luminence change you have enstated and cut the effect in half. </span><br /><br />Transitions are for enhanced communication and engagement... Not for the sake of the effect alone.<br /><br />Happy Story Telling!</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2013-12-24T03:12:50.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2013-12-24T03:12:50.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2006-11-22T22:15:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":57,"uuid":"02f05821-eb0c-44ef-964a-63d0b11064f8","title":"Designing a Component","slug":"designing-a-component","markdown":"<img src=\"http://billwscott.com/files/carousel.gif\" width=\"130\" /><br /><br />I’ve designed a number of software widgets, components and gadgets throughout my career. In the early days of Mac programming I created small desktop accessories and my own set of components to enhance my application development (e.g., geographical map component, 3D graphics library).<br /><br />Later in the days of Motif I wrote numerous components (spreadsheets, charts, directed graphs, server-side grids). I also made a trek through the TCL community creating components for the incr Widgets set.<br /><br />I spent several years working in the world of Java Swing building components (in fact I built at least three completely different component sets for three different companies—thank God that we now see more things getting open sourced!)<br /><br />I finally ended up in the land of web development taking trysts through HTC components, JSP/Struts components (tag libraries) and finally pure JavaScript components. There are a lot of lessons I have learned over the years in how to create useful components. There are three that stand out in my thinking:<br /><ul><br /><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Make the component specific in purpose, yet flexible in use. </span></li><br />Avoid the do-everything component.

One of the traps that people fall into is trying to build a component that does everything. Not unlike feature creep in application development, a component can collapse under the weight of too many features. One of the sure signs of this is when certain parts of the API start competing with other parts of the API.<br /><br />As an example, let's look at the <a href=\"carousel-component-y-ui-library-example\">carousel</a>. It is just a simple list view manager. You can actually make the carousel look like a <a href=\"http://billwscott.com/carousel/carousel_tabs.html\">tabset</a> or a <a href=\"http://billwscott.com/carousel/carousel_slides.html\">slideshow</a>. However, I chose not to provide additional tabset or slideshow functionality. Why? I knew from experience that the interface would become unwieldy. Lots of new configuration parameters and methods would get added that only made sense if you were using the carousel strictly in slideshow mode. You can imagine that with enough features, some of the API would only apply to these tangential behaviors. The result would be a carousel component that ends up with portions of API that don’t even apply when the carousel is behaving “just” as a carousel.<br /><br />A nice way to keep a component flexible is by providing a simple configuration mechanism. The Yahoo! UI library provides a Configuration object for just this purpose. (The first time I saw this mechanism in popular use was with the <a href=\"http://prototype.conio.net/\">Prototype</a> library.) Instead of having to pass lots of parameters to the carousel’s constructor (new Carousel()), you pass in a configuration object. The configuration object is really just an object that contains parameters and values encoded in JavaScript object notation. Here is an example from the wrap example:<br /><pre><br />   var carousel = new YAHOO.extension.Carousel(\"dhtml-carousel\",<br />       {<br />           numVisible:        4,<br />           animationSpeed:    .8,<br />           animationMethod:   YAHOO.util.Easing.easeBoth,<br />           scrollInc:         3,<br />           navMargin:         40,<br />           size:              17,<br />           loadInitHandler:   loadInitialItems,<br />           prevElementID:     \"prev-arrow\",<br />           nextElementID:     \"next-arrow\",<br />           loadNextHandler:   loadNextItems,<br />           loadPrevHandler:   loadPrevItems,<br />           prevButtonStateHandler:   handlePrevButtonState,<br />           nextButtonStateHandler:   handleNextButtonState,<br />           wrap: true<br />       }<br />   );<br /></pre><br />Each configuration parameter has a default value. If the user provides a configuration parameter it is treated as an override and is applied to the internal set of configuration values. The carousel then uses these values in its operation.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Keep Concerns Separate </span></span><br />Separate the concerns of interface, interaction, and content.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://billwscott.com/files/3dim_web.png\" /><br /><br />If you have read other articles on my blog or heard me speak you will notice that I often fall back on this idea of separation of concerns along the lines of interface, interaction and content (or data). Sometimes I express it as feedback, interaction and information. And often I just state in the way I first learned it from the boys at Xerox as simply <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller\">Model-View-Controller</a>.<br /><br />When I wrote the carousel I started with the basic understanding that I was creating a list view manager. The underlying HTML structure I chose to control was an “unordered list” (UL &amp; LI HTML tags). Keeping my thinking general in this matter allowed me to separate several areas of concern. Here is how this concept of separation played out in the carousel.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">1. Flexibility of Visual Style</span><br />First I wanted to provide flexibility in the component’s presentation. One of the ways I did this was by putting all style choices into a stylesheet (CSS). It’s really easy to hard-code style choices into the component logic. By placing style considerations externally you can help fulfill the first point above – keep it flexible. The other way the presentation was made flexible was by providing configuration parameters that select the way items are displayed. Control over the number of visible items, the animation speed and method, the size of a page of information, and the orientation are all ways that the carousel is flexible enough to adapt to most environments.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2. Flexibility of Interaction</span><br />Second, I decided that the interaction should be completely flexible. I did not want to constrain it to my choice of navigation controls or method of user interaction. In most of the current examples, previous and next arrow buttons control the carousel. While this is the normal case, it is easy enough to allow mouse over events drive the interface. The carousel exposes the same interfaces it uses internally. You can simply wire your events to the same internal mechanisms used by the carousel internally.<br /><br />Microsoft Altas (now called Microsoft Ajax Framework) does a nice job of separating behavior from its components. For example, they isolated the behavior of auto complete from the components. This means that if you add this behavior to say a text field you would have an auto complete text field. It also means that you can write your own components and by obeying an interface contract, have your component support this behavior. In essense the interaction is packaged as a separate entity and just attached to the component needing the behavior.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">3. Flexibility in Content</span><br />And third, I felt that there had to be flexibility in the way content gets displayed in the carousel. The simplest mechanism for this was to allow developers a way to shove their own HTML into any item in the list. The innerHTML technique is very useful in this regard. It is very friendly to PHP, JSP, ASP and other page generation techniques. It’s also the native way to express an interface on the web. What this means is that each “item” in the list could be a complete page of content, a single photo from a photo stream, a set of form elements—in short anything you want a “list item” to be it can be.<br /><br />Another dimension of content is in how the data actually gets loaded. By externalizing the loading mechanism through a set of function callbacks (functions that you write that let you decide how to load the initial set of data and fetch the next and previous set of data) the component is able to support static data, client side generated data or server-side fetched data (e.g. via Ajax). Recently someone wanted to wire the carousel up to RSS feeds. Even though I had not considered RSS feeds, since the data loading was externalized, it turned out to be a fairly trivial exercise.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Test by Documentation and Usage</span></span><br />Document the interface and use the component before releasing it.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://billwscott.com/files/carousel_doc.png\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Cooper\">Alan Cooper</a> advocates that designers design in pairs. One takes the role of Interaction Designer (ID), the other the role of Document Communicator (DC). In design sessions the ID takes the lead role in pitching ideas. The DC tries to capture the ideas and wherever there is difficulty in capturing or explaining the idea it is forced to go through some iterations to make it easier to communicate. The idea is that by having to explain your ideas. This doesn’t just work in designing user interfaces, but it also works in designing programmer interfaces.<br /><br />As I am writing this blog post I am sitting next to <a href=\"http://lukew.com/\">Luke Wroblewski</a> on a flight back from Lisbon. He saw this point in my article and reminded me of a post he wrote a while back on <a href=\"http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?209\">Nine Lessons from Nine Years of Interface Design</a>. One of the lessons he notes is that “writing it down forces you to think it through.” On this point he summarize three good reasons for writing it down:<br /><ul><br /><li>Solidifies the approach. Guards against localized decisions.</li><br /><li>Articulates the rationale. Puts the solution in context of its use.</li><br /><li>Ensures clarity. If you can’t explain it, then nobody else will be able to either.</li><br /></ul><br />I find the exercise of both documenting and writing demos for components to be refreshing. It gives you a chance to come above the code cloud and both talk to the user and be the user of the component you are writing.<br /><br />I finished the first version of the carousel in just 2 days. I spent the better part of the next 2 days writing documentation and creating demos for it. All during that phase I was constantly going back and rewriting parts of the code. Documentation can seen as a kind of test-first strategy for writing APIs. Writing demos is a good way to create tutorials as well as experience what it is like to really use your component.<br /><br />Of course the biggest caution I would have about trusting too much in the demo applications you write is to realize that they are only demo applications. It really takes being exercised in several real world examples to fine tune an interface.<br /><br />This lesson follows something that we try to employ at Yahoo! We call it “eat your own dog food.”<br /><br />The phenomona of <a href=\"http://hackday.org/\">Yahoo! Hack Day</a> has had a profound impact on the web services and APIs throughout Yahoo! (I would go so far as arguing that this has been the biggest impact of Hack Day—causing our services and APIs to become more robust.) When the Hack Team attempted to put together a combination of our APIs (events, maps, search, etc.) they discovered just how many things were missing. The creation of just that one demo pushed the discussion of what needed to be added or corrected—-and the result is a much richer API available to everyone (public included.)","html":"<p><img src=\"http://billwscott.com/files/carousel.gif\" width=\"130\" /><br /><br />I’ve designed a number of software widgets, components and gadgets throughout my career.

(I would go so far as arguing that this has been the biggest impact of Hack Day—causing our services and APIs to become more robust.) When the Hack Team attempted to put together a combination of our APIs (events, maps, search, etc.) they discovered just how many things were missing. The creation of just that one demo pushed the discussion of what needed to be added or corrected—-and the result is a much richer API available to everyone (public included.)</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2013-12-24T03:12:50.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2013-12-24T03:12:50.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2006-10-05T16:44:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":58,"uuid":"a6c870f8-1cf0-4368-9765-5cae97db88ac","title":"In the Flow: Scrybe","slug":"in-the-flow-scrybe","markdown":"Someone pointed me to a new product that is in limited beta release.

I have had an amazing 1.5 years here getting a chance to launch the public <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/\">design pattern library</a>, doing evangelism for Yahoo!, creating some components and working on some cool projects inside Yahoo!<br /><br />As I looked at 2007 I could see that a number of opportunities still existed for me to go out and speak. In fact I had about a dozen events already in play through the middle of June.<br /><br />Sometime last year I began helping (part-time) with technology and design consultation for a new Yahoo! site. I am not at liberty to announce the product at this time but at the first of the year I was offered the chance to become the engineering manager for this team. The product is an awesome idea and it promises to \"do good\" for our society. So with a passion for the goal, the product, the team and the challenges, it was a no-brainer for me to decide to step out of the evangelism role and take on the challege of putting into practice all the things I have been talking so much about. It's time to get in the trenches!<br /><br />I am leaving a very talented evangelism team to join another extremely talented team that I feel honored to work with here in Sunnyvale. The current engineering team (in Bangalore) is doing an incredibly awesome job getting the first version of the product ready.<br /><br />My management graciously offered (even encouraged) me to continue my speaking adventures. But I decided that in order to have sanity in my life and in order to do the best job for the product I would pull back from speaking and put my head down into this project. I subsequently canceled most of the events lined up and at this point I think I only have one event left to speak at this year.<br /><br />I am considering taking the material from my talks and putting it into a book or ebook. But in the meanwhile I think the best thing is to start writing a series of blog posts that capture the current thinking I have on the topic of design patterns, principles and practices.

I have had an amazing 1.5 years here getting a chance to launch the public <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/\">design pattern library</a>, doing evangelism for Yahoo!, creating some components and working on some cool projects inside Yahoo!<br /><br />As I looked at 2007 I could see that a number of opportunities still existed for me to go out and speak. In fact I had about a dozen events already in play through the middle of June.<br /><br />Sometime last year I began helping (part-time) with technology and design consultation for a new Yahoo! site. I am not at liberty to announce the product at this time but at the first of the year I was offered the chance to become the engineering manager for this team. The product is an awesome idea and it promises to \"do good\" for our society. So with a passion for the goal, the product, the team and the challenges, it was a no-brainer for me to decide to step out of the evangelism role and take on the challege of putting into practice all the things I have been talking so much about. It's time to get in the trenches!<br /><br />I am leaving a very talented evangelism team to join another extremely talented team that I feel honored to work with here in Sunnyvale. The current engineering team (in Bangalore) is doing an incredibly awesome job getting the first version of the product ready.<br /><br />My management graciously offered (even encouraged) me to continue my speaking adventures. But I decided that in order to have sanity in my life and in order to do the best job for the product I would pull back from speaking and put my head down into this project. I subsequently canceled most of the events lined up and at this point I think I only have one event left to speak at this year.<br /><br />I am considering taking the material from my talks and putting it into a book or ebook. But in the meanwhile I think the best thing is to start writing a series of blog posts that capture the current thinking I have on the topic of design patterns, principles and practices.

Teachers and the Yahoo! Gobbler","slug":"yahoo-teachers-and-the-yahoo-gobbler","markdown":"In my last post I said that I was putting my head down to work on something at Yahoo! that I believe strongly in. Strongly enough to set aside my evangelism role and focus on a single product within Yahoo!<br /><br />I am glad to say that I can now freely, publicly talk about what I am now doing at Yahoo!<br /><br />On Thursday, at the <a href=\"http://www.nsta.org/\">National Science Teachers Association</a> in St. Louis, we announced that a new site, <a href=\"http://teachers.yahoo.com\">Yahoo! Teachers</a> will go live at the start of the summer.<br /><br />Before I explain what it is and why I think it's cool, let me go back a little in time and talk about this scrappy team within Yahoo! that wanted to \"hack the educational system.\"<br /><br />Last summer we held a Yahoo! Teachers of Merit camp on our campus in Sunnyvale. We invited about 60-70 teachers to come spend 7 or 8 days with us. The first couple of days was about how teachers could take advantage of the web and of course we talked about things like <a href=\"http://del.icio.us\">delicious</a> and <a href=\"http://flickr.com\">flickr</a> as well as Yahoo! Groups. But beyond that we gave them some new tools to gather, organize and share information with teachers around the world.<br /><br />One of the key tools was the Gobbler, an idea conceived by Karon Weber (formerly of Pixar) and others. Just two weeks before the camp and one week after I created the carousel the team did not have the gobbler built or even started. I was simply an occasional consultant on the team (in my role as evangelist). Prodded by Samantha Tripodi (lead designer), I took the next 3 days to try to bring the Gobbler to life. Fortunately I was able to do so. And by the time of camp I had a good enough version of the gobbler to unleash on the teachers.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://billwscott.com/files/gobbler-snap.png\" /><br /><br />I recall the first time the teachers saw the gobbler in action. I was sitting in front of the room and I heard a room full of teachers gasp (literally). They were surprised you could do something like this. They immediately got it. And saw how it would help them gather knowledge from the web and share with other teachers around the world.<br /><br />Ok, so what is it?<br /><br />The gobbler is simply a widget that you can popup on any web page and just grab text, images and links from the page and drag and drop them into your Y!Teachers projects. (You can also bookmark the site as well).<br /><br />Its a little like Google Notebook, bluemark, clipmarks and other clipping services but it is a little unique. First, you can simply tear things off the page with drag and drop. Second, when you drop things from the page into the gobbler you are dropping them directly into your projects within Yahoo! Teachers. They get immediately saved there. Third, the assets you drop are thus brushed with meta data from the project itself (like grade level, subject, state standards). Fourth, the projects (and the assets) are then shared with any teacher anywhere in the world that is part of Yahoo! Teachers.<br /><br />The combination of gather (gobbler), organize (projects) and share (teacher network) creates a powerful combination.<br /><br />As always seeing it is the best way to understand it (sorry the sound is a little quiet... will repost later with better sound).<br /><br /><br /><br />This week at the NSTA, we showed Yahoo! Teachers and the gobbler to hundreds and hundreds of teachers. The response was overwhelmingly enthusiastic about both Y! Teachers and especially the gobbler.<br /><br />I am glad that almost 10 months after creating the gobbler I can finally talk about it :-)http://www2.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gif<br /><br />And in a just a short amount of time teachers will be able to use these tools to make their job a little easier.<br /><br />If you or someone you know is a teacher, head over to Y!

Ideally you should be able to express an interaction in a declarative manner without having to write JavaScript directly (but not kept from it if you need to). And even more ideally you should be able to build up the \"legos\" of interaction in simple GUI tool embedded in the browser so that you are not encumbered with even a simple syntax to type in.<br /><br />So back in July, I was slated to give a talk at the Ajax Experience. I promised a few months before that I would have 2 new talks. One on Anti-Patterns (yes I owe several blog posts on that one) and the other on prototyping.<br /><br />The problem was exactly one week before both talks I had literally had not time to put those talks together. So I dropped out for a few days to create a very early version of what is now protoscript. The good news was that it was actually fully functioning and I gave a peek of it at the conference. <br /><br />I got a lot of good feedback from the talk and went back and rewrote it a couple of times, changed up some of my approach, moved to a plug-in style architecture, etc.<br /><br />So, ok, what is protoscript?<br /><br /><img src=\"http://protoscript.com/images/promo.gif\" /><br /><br />Protoscript is a simplified scripting language for creating Ajax style prototypes for the Web. With Protoscript it's easy to bring interface elements to life. Simply connect them to behaviors and events to create complex interactions.<br /><br />The key abstraction that came out of my thinking was to express everything as objects (think HTML elements), behaviors (think patterns) and events (both events and callbacks).<br /><br />In some ways it is similar to jQuery. And in fact I use jQuery for the selecting of elements. Protoscript, however, is a very stylized way to describe interactions. This makes it ideal as a building block.<br /><br />For example, since the language is so simple (It is actually in JSON format) it makes it easier to extend to multiple toolkits (currently I use YUI, but I have built a simple example with Mootools), add new behaviors and events and even more importantly be able to build GUI tools on top of it.<br /><br />As a first hack I created Protoscripter a bookmarklet that brings a GUI interface to any web page allowing you to play with protoscript (without any installation, other than the bookmarklet) and experiment with interactions.<br /><br />I have been careful about pushing protoscript out because of this layering approach. Ideally I would have the whole stack. I would have a complete GUI as a FF extension allowing designers, product marketing or web devs to quickly sprinkle interactions onto their prototypes and quickly iterate to the best design. Well that is not reality. I have invested about 2-3 weeks of time so far and feel I have gotten it to the right level to release to the public.<br /><br />There are 31 behaviors, 40+ live demos, a simple GUI tool (protoscripter). The scripting engine seems to be pretty solid (knock on wood). I have a full wiki with full documentation on all those behaviors. The code is over in Google Code in a repository ready for open source contribution.<br /><br />So to kick it off I am giving a talk this morning at the Rich Web Experience here in San Jose.

Out of the box I support YUI as the behavior set (behaviors, events, callbacks and attributes) and jQuery as the selector mechanism (supports CSS selector syntax and XPath). But Protoscript allows you to add any number of new behaviors, write your own behavior set on other Javascript toolkits and plug in a different selector query mechanism.<br /><br />This means that Protoscript is really not in opposition to tools like jQuery. I really like jQuery. I have always been a fan of syntactical sugar. It lessons the cognitive load when writing code.<br /><br />jQuery has a powerful chaining and filtering mechanism that allows you to control the scope of elements you are applying behavior to.<br /><br />Some of the advantages of Protoscript over jQuery for prototyping are:<br /><ul><li>In jQuery, behaviors are passed parameters and since they can vary in the number of parameters that get passed to them it is not easy to parse, stylize of guess at what must be passed.

Since they are attributes they can also be read by external gui tools to automatically create a GUI interface</li><li>Protoscript uses a nested syntax instead of a single line of chained code. This allows protoscript to express chained behavior, changing scope and attaching behaviors &amp; events (both can be done easily in jQuery). Where the JSON syntax gives a novel twist is now you can express in one interaction set a number of serial as well as chained actions.<br /></li><li>Event expression is richer in JSON since you can express multiple events in serial fashion along with multiple callbacks thus capturing the forking nature of interaction as a tree instead of a single list.</li></ul>Now I hasten to add that I do not believe Protoscript in anyway replaces jQuery.

I am from Dallas. So with the cowboys doing such an incredible job and the local teams being so horrible I decided to watch some \"good football\". So I added the NFL Ticket to my DirecTV. As a \"bonus\" they give you NFL SuperCast. Its a way to watch football online when you are traveling, etc.<br /><br />So after logging in to the DirecTV site and digging around in the left nav I found the SuperFan (also called SuperCast :-) Login link. Here is the page presented to me:<br /><div id=\"m424\" style=\"padding:1em 0;text-align:left;\"><div id=\"o9as\" style=\"padding:1em 0;text-align:left;\"><div id=\"jj2h\" style=\"padding:1em 0;text-align:left;\"><img src=\"http://billwscott.com/files/directv/directv1.gif\" /></div></div>Apart for the confusing use of \"SuperFan\" and \"SuperCast\" here was my thought process:<br /><ul><li>I am logged in (A)<br /></li><li>It recognizes me as a Registered DTV customer (B)</li><li>But wait, it is asking me if I am registered (C)<br /></li><ul><li>Does that mean I am not registered with the SuperFan service? Because it surely knows I am registered (since I am logged in)<br /></li><li>Am I a Sunday Ticket SuperFan subscriber? Heck, I am logged in-- you don't know? Yes of course I am.<br /></li><li>Hmmm... maybe I need to \"Register\" my DTV account with the SuperFan service? (D)</li></ul><li>Its also asking me if I am even a DirectTV customer. Huh?<br /></li></ul>At this point I clicked \"REGISTER\" (thinking I need to register with the SuperFan service).<br /><div id=\"vlwc\" style=\"padding:1em 0;text-align:left;\"><div id=\"entg\" style=\"padding:1em 0;text-align:left;\"><img src=\"http://billwscott.com/files/directv/directv2.gif\" /></div>Did you catch the error message?<br /><br /><div style=\"margin-left:40px;\"><i>You are currently logged in or we are recognizing someone else that has been using this computer. At the top of the page you can either log out or </i><b><i>let us know if we are recognizing you or not.<br /><br /></i></b> </div> Huh?<br /><br />Ok, so my problem is I was reading too much in the first page.<br /><br />Notice the message \"Not a DirecTV customer\" (E) and the \"Order Now\" (F).<br /><br />Even though I am logged in (and thus registered) and have SuperCast/SuperFan the rest of the page does not know if I am registered, if I have SuperCast or even if I have DirectTV!<br /></div>This is an example of the Anti-Pattern: Misguided Misdirection. It happens when a page has misleading cues, calls to actions, etc. leading the user to do the wrong thing. Notice the large call to actions on the page are \"REGISTER\" and \"ORDER NOW\". In reality since I am logged in and a SuperCast member and a DirecTV customer, I don't need all the advertising  pleas to get me registered and to buy DirectTV.<br /><br />What is even more frustrating is after calling the customer support line I suggested they put a note in for the web team to fix this incorrect messaging. I got a \"cold shoulder\" response and it was obvious that DirecTV did not have a process for this to happen nor did the customer support person care in the least that this page creates a lot of unnecessary calls to their call center.<br /><br />At Netflix we try to listen carefully to our call center. One recent example was our reps telling us (in a focus group) that they were getting frequent calls with users not being able to find the Member Login link when they come to the Netflix site logged out. The fix? Real simple. Enlarge the \"Member Login\" link and change the background making this easier to find. The good news-- It worked!<br /><div id=\"vvw9\" style=\"padding:1em 0;text-align:left;\"><img src=\"http://billwscott.com/files/directv/directv3.gif\" /></div></div>","html":"<p>Ok, so I moved to the bay area a couple of years back. I am from Dallas. So with the cowboys doing such an incredible job and the local teams being so horrible I decided to watch some \"good football\". So I added the NFL Ticket to my DirecTV. As a \"bonus\" they give you NFL SuperCast. Its a way to watch football online when you are traveling, etc.<br /><br />So after logging in to the DirecTV site and digging around in the left nav I found the SuperFan (also called SuperCast :-) Login link. Here is the page presented to me:<br /><div id=\"m424\" style=\"padding:1em 0;text-align:left;\"><div id=\"o9as\" style=\"padding:1em 0;text-align:left;\"><div id=\"jj2h\" style=\"padding:1em 0;text-align:left;\"><img src=\"http://billwscott.com/files/directv/directv1.gif\" /></div></div>Apart for the confusing use of \"SuperFan\" and \"SuperCast\" here was my thought process:<br /><ul><li>I am logged in (A)<br /></li><li>It recognizes me as a Registered DTV customer (B)</li><li>But wait, it is asking me if I am registered (C)<br /></li><ul><li>Does that mean I am not registered with the SuperFan service? Because it surely knows I am registered (since I am logged in)<br /></li><li>Am I a Sunday Ticket SuperFan subscriber? Heck, I am logged in-- you don't know? Yes of course I am.<br /></li><li>Hmmm... maybe I need to \"Register\" my DTV account with the SuperFan service? (D)</li></ul><li>Its also asking me if I am even a DirectTV customer. Huh?<br /></li></ul>At this point I clicked \"REGISTER\" (thinking I need to register with the SuperFan service).<br /><div id=\"vlwc\" style=\"padding:1em 0;text-align:left;\"><div id=\"entg\" style=\"padding:1em 0;text-align:left;\"><img src=\"http://billwscott.com/files/directv/directv2.gif\" /></div>Did you catch the error message?<br /><br /><div style=\"margin-left:40px;\"><i>You are currently logged in or we are recognizing someone else that has been using this computer. At the top of the page you can either log out or </i><b><i>let us know if we are recognizing you or not.<br /><br /></i></b> </div> Huh?<br /><br />Ok, so my problem is I was reading too much in the first page.<br /><br />Notice the message \"Not a DirecTV customer\" (E) and the \"Order Now\" (F).<br /><br />Even though I am logged in (and thus registered) and have SuperCast/SuperFan the rest of the page does not know if I am registered, if I have SuperCast or even if I have DirectTV!<br /></div>This is an example of the Anti-Pattern: Misguided Misdirection. It happens when a page has misleading cues, calls to actions, etc. leading the user to do the wrong thing. Notice the large call to actions on the page are \"REGISTER\" and \"ORDER NOW\". In reality since I am logged in and a SuperCast member and a DirecTV customer, I don't need all the advertising  pleas to get me registered and to buy DirectTV.<br /><br />What is even more frustrating is after calling the customer support line I suggested they put a note in for the web team to fix this incorrect messaging. I got a \"cold shoulder\" response and it was obvious that DirecTV did not have a process for this to happen nor did the customer support person care in the least that this page creates a lot of unnecessary calls to their call center.<br /><br />At Netflix we try to listen carefully to our call center.

Let me rant some more :-)<br /><br />Besides being a good example of the <a href=\"anti-pattern-one-at-a-time-google-blogger-reader-and-backpackit\">One at a Time</a> Anti-Pattern it is also a good example of the Pogo Stick Anti-Pattern (I first heard this term from <a href=\"http://www.uie.com/\">Jared Spool</a>). I define it as:<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Requiring the user to go down a level or two, perform an operation, come back to the top and then have to go back down again. The name comes from hopping up and down through the site.<br /><br /></span>In the Google Blogger example I described the process of deleting comments requiring a multi-step process:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thescottclan/2375653142/\" title=\"blogger-pogo-stick-illust.png by billwscott, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2298/2375653142_093cea8635_o.png\" alt=\"blogger-pogo-stick-illust.png\" height=\"164\" width=\"563\" /></a><br /><font size=\"1\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Pogo Sticking in Google Blogger</span></font><br /><br />It takes three page refreshes to complete the operation and return to where you started.<br /><br />Compare this to the way you can delete in <a href=\"http://www.backpackit.com/\">Backpackit</a>.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thescottclan/2374864771/\" title=\"backpackit-delete-illust.png by billwscott, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2194/2374864771_ef66653bd6_o.png\" alt=\"backpackit-delete-illust.png\" height=\"548\" width=\"350\" /></a><br /><font size=\"1\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Backpackit provides an in page one step delete</span></font><br /><br />What to do about delete confirmation? <br /><ol><li>Don't provide one. If the item is trivial (like an item in a list) you can just let the user delete it without bothering them with an <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">idiot box</span> (pointless confirmation).</li><li>Provide one. In Google Reader they use the standard Alert mechanism. This is less than desirable since depending on the operating system the confirmation can appear far away from the deleted item. On the Mac, the alert slides out under the title bar which forces the user to move the mouse far away from the delete operation.

I define it as:<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Requiring the user to go down a level or two, perform an operation, come back to the top and then have to go back down again. The name comes from hopping up and down through the site.<br /><br /></span>In the Google Blogger example I described the process of deleting comments requiring a multi-step process:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thescottclan/2375653142/\" title=\"blogger-pogo-stick-illust.png by billwscott, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2298/2375653142_093cea8635_o.png\" alt=\"blogger-pogo-stick-illust.png\" height=\"164\" width=\"563\" /></a><br /><font size=\"1\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Pogo Sticking in Google Blogger</span></font><br /><br />It takes three page refreshes to complete the operation and return to where you started.<br /><br />Compare this to the way you can delete in <a href=\"http://www.backpackit.com/\">Backpackit</a>.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thescottclan/2374864771/\" title=\"backpackit-delete-illust.png by billwscott, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2194/2374864771_ef66653bd6_o.png\" alt=\"backpackit-delete-illust.png\" height=\"548\" width=\"350\" /></a><br /><font size=\"1\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Backpackit provides an in page one step delete</span></font><br /><br />What to do about delete confirmation? <br /><ol><li>Don't provide one. If the item is trivial (like an item in a list) you can just let the user delete it without bothering them with an <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">idiot box</span> (pointless confirmation).</li><li>Provide one. In Google Reader they use the standard Alert mechanism. This is less than desirable since depending on the operating system the confirmation can appear far away from the deleted item. On the Mac, the alert slides out under the title bar which forces the user to move the mouse far away from the delete operation. Another approach is to provide a lightweight overlay (with a DIV or iFrame) to confirm the delete. They can appear quickly and in context with the operation.</li><li>Provide an Undo.

In particular, the work of <a href=\"http://stevesouders.com/\">Steve Souders</a>, the <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/\">Yahoo! performance team</a>, <a href=\"http://www.julienlecomte.net/blog/2008/06/50/\">others</a> who are writing about Ajax performance is the playlist for what to optimize. As <a href=\"http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/schedule/speaker/5039\">Eric Lawrence</a> of Microsoft said to Steve, \"Our mission is to make your book on performance be out of date.\"<br /><br />This is a very different picture from a few years back.<br /><br />I still find it very disappointing that the Safari team is always absent at these discussions. I realize that Safari is kicking butt in performance (I will post examples from our round trip stats to show that) but it really is important that they are approachable by the community. But this seems to be the way of Apple unfortunately.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:130%;\"><a href=\"http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/schedule/proceedings\">Some Great Talks</a></span><br />There were a lot of good talks, but here are the ones that stood out to me (I did miss both mornings).<br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/asset/attachment/3105\">Building Faster Pages in Firefox and Internet Explorer</a> - This is not the same presentation as was presented &amp; Mozilla's is missing, hopefully they will post their slides.<br /></li><li><a href=\"http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/asset/attachment/3128\">Even Faster Web Sites</a> - This is the start of Steve's next book on Web Site performance.<br /></li><li><a href=\"http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/asset/attachment/1956\">High Performance Ajax Applications</a> - Julien's in depth look at tuning the world of DHTML.<br /></li><li><a href=\"http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/asset/attachment/3104\">Hotmail's Performance Tuning Best Practices</a> - This has some great material.

Anyone that reads my blog regularly knows that I am a champion for great user experiences. Often the performance angle is not included in discussions of the user experience. But as we all know the best design can be crippled by sluggish execution, waiting a long time for a page to be fully interactive or feedback that does not come in a timely manner.<br /><font size=\"4\"><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Timing \"from Click to Done\" - Full Cycle Experience</span></font><br />User performance experience focuses on what is the full cycle time from when the user requests a page or invokes an action till a new page is ready for interaction or the action has completed. Most sites have various ways of tracing parts of the performance puzzle. Often backend instrumentation is inserted to time backend services. But a lot of sites don't have a complete picture of just how much time is the user spending from the time <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">they click it till the time they get it</span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">back (done)</span>.<br /><br />To address this issue at Netflix, one of the first things I initiated after joining Netflix was the creation of full cycle tracers. Kim Trott (on my team) took the idea, ran with it, fleshed it out and turned it into reality.<br /><br />The idea of tracing the full cycle time is to:<br /><ul><li>Capture the start time</li><li>Capture various points of interest</li><li>Capture the end time</li><li>Log the results<br /></li></ul><br /><font style=\"font-weight:bold;\" size=\"4\">Capture the Start Time (\"from Click\")</font><br />To get a full cycle time we need to capture the point in time the user makes a request. <br /><br />At Neflix we use the following stack of technologies: Java, JSP, Struts2, Tiles2, HTML, CSS and Javascript. Within the normal HTTP request/response cycle our requests are handled via Java servlets (eventually routing through to JSP for Web pages). <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thescottclan/2596587622/\" title=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-starttime.png (by billwscott)\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3173/2596587622_38683b4e34.jpg\" title=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-starttime.png (by billwscott)\" alt=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-starttime.png (by billwscott)\" height=\"236\" width=\"420\" /></a><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Unload Event </span><br />The most logical place to measure the start of a request (\"from Click\") is on the originating page (see <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A</span> in figure above). The straighforward approach is to add a timing capture to the unload event (or onbeforeunload). More than one technique exist for persisting this measurement, but the most common way is to write the timing information (like URL, user agent, start time, etc.) to a cookie. <br /><br />However, there is a downside to this methodology. If the user navigates to your home page from elsewhere (e.g., from a google search), then there will be no \"start time\" captured since the unload event never happened on your site. So we need a more consistent \"start time\".<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Start of Servlet Response </span><br />We address this by providing an alternate start time. We instrument a time capture at the very earliest point in the servlet that handles the request at the beginning of the response (see <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">B</span> in figure above). This guarantees that we will  always have a start time. While it does miss the time it takes to handle the request, it ends up capturing the important part of the round trip time -- from response generation outward.<br /><br />There are a number of ways to save this information so that it can be passed along through the response cycle to finally be logged. You can write out a server-side cookie. You can generate JSON objects that get embedded in the page. You could even pass along parameters in the URL (though this would not be desirable for a number of reasons). The point is you will need a way to persist the data until it gets out to the generated page for logging.<br /><br />Note that the absolute time captured here is in server clock time and not client clock time. There is no guarantee these values will be in sync. We will discuss how we handle this later.<br /><br /><font style=\"font-weight:bold;\" size=\"4\">Capture Intereresting Points Along the Way</font><br />After capturing the start point there are a few other standard points of time we would like to capture.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thescottclan/2596604434/\" title=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-tweentimes.png (by billwscott)\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3059/2596604434_fd38ba245a.jpg\" title=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-tweentimes.png (by billwscott)\" alt=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-tweentimes.png (by billwscott)\" height=\"245\" width=\"420\" /></a><br /><br />Two points of interest are captured on the servlet side:<br /><ul><li>When we begin generating the HTML for the page (<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">C</span>)</li><li>When we end generating the HTML for the page (<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">E</span>)</li></ul>Two points of interest are captured on the client side:<br /><ul><li>When start rendering the HTML for the page (<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">D</span>)</li><li>When we end processing the HTML for the page (<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">F</span>)</li></ul><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">C</span> &amp; <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">E</span> deal with page generation. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">D</span> &amp; <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">F</span> deal with page rendering.<br /><br />In <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">D</span>, we emit a scriptlet immediately after emitting the  tag that saves <span style=\"font-family:Courier;\">new Date()).getTime()</span> into a Javascript object on the page.<br /><br />In <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">F</span>, we emit a scriplet immediately after emitting the  tag that saves <span style=\"font-family:Courier;\">new Date()).getTime()</span> into a Javascript object on the page.<br /><br />When the page starts rendering the HEAD it will execute <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">D</span> and store the time stamp.

In parallel, the browser has been loading CSS, Javascript, requesting images and rendering the page. But the page is not ready for the user to interact with (typically) until the <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">onload</span> event is finished for the page (see <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">G </span>in diagram below). <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thescottclan/2596664048/\" title=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-endtime.png (by billwscott)\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3170/2596664048_32e3c7a55b.jpg\" title=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-endtime.png (by billwscott)\" alt=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-endtime.png (by billwscott)\" height=\"278\" width=\"500\" /></a><br /><br />We attempt to insert our instrumentation as the very last item to be handled in the onload event for the page.<br /><br /><font size=\"4\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Logging the Captured Times</span></font><br />Here is a diagram that shows the various time points we capture (8) and the measures we derive (5).<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thescottclan/2595821783/\" title=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-alltimes.png (by billwscott)\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3109/2595821783_6d425a634a.jpg\" title=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-alltimes.png (by billwscott)\" alt=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-alltimes.png (by billwscott)\" height=\"352\" width=\"500\" /></a><br /><br />The five measurements are:<br /><ul><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Elapsed client request time</span> (G-A). Full cycle time. The total time it took to request the page, receive the response and render the page. Not available if the referring page is not a Netflix page. This is not available for all measurements.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Elapsed server response</span> (E-B). How much time was spent generating the server response.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Elapsed client render</span> (G-D). How much time it took the client to render the page (and get the server response). Since we stream our response to the client, there's no way to differentiate how much of the client rendering time was spent getting the response from the server vs. rendering the page. The browser will start to render the page as it receives the content from the server.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Elapsed server plus client</span> (C-B) + (G-D). Total time to render; full time to generate the response and render it client-side. This is the key measure we use as it includes the most reliable start time (that we can capture all the time). It is the summation of the client render time (G-D) and the elapsed server response (C-B). By taking the deltas on the client and the server separately we can safely add their values together to get a total time (even though they are captured in different server clock times). The caveat is there can be some gap between the time C emits the HEAD tag and the corresponding Javascript time stamp and the time D starts rendering. In practice we have found this time to be sufficiently small on the whole so have kept to this simple approach.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Elapsed  client render after body</span> (G-F). This gives us an idea of how much additional time is needed to get the page fully loaded after rendering the body.<br /></li></ul>At this point we can gather up the five values (persisted so far via server-side and client-side cookies or some other methodology) and write these out to a server log. This could be done via an Ajax call, using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bug\">beacons</a>, an <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/print/no-refresh-links\">HTTP request with a NO-CONTENT </a>response or some other mechanism. The back end service caches up results and writes them to a database for later analysis.<br /><br /><font style=\"font-weight:bold;\" size=\"4\">The Benefit of Measuring</font><br />We could have chosen to implement all the yslow <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/index.html#rules\">performance suggestions</a> without measuring anything. Most likely they would all be wins for us. But by putting a full user experience performance tracing mechanism in place we can be confident that enhancements, features, or even attempts at performance improvement did not negatively affect site performance.<br /><br />Recently we fielded a different variation of our star ratings widget. While it cut the number of HTTP requests in half for large Queue pages (a good thing) it actually degraded performance. Having real time performance data let us narrow down on the culprit. This feedback loops is an excellent learning tool for performance. With our significant customer base, large number of daily page hits we can get a really reliable read on the performance our users are experiencing. As a side note, the <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">median</span> is the best way to summarize our measurements as it nicely takes care of the outliers (think of the widely varying bandwidths, different browser performance profiles that can all affect measurements.)<br /><br /><font style=\"font-weight:bold;\" size=\"4\">In future articles </font><br /><ul><li>Discuss what has worked and not worked.</li><li>Discuss an internal firebug extension I wrote to visualize this data for our developers.</li><li>Compare Safari vs Firefox vs IE -- the results are really interesting.</li><li>Announce a new Firebug Extension that helps visualize performance page data.</li></ul><font style=\"font-weight:bold;\" size=\"4\">Hear More About this at the Velocity Conference</font><br />As I mentioned in my previous article I will be giving a 15 minute talk on <a href=\"http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/schedule/detail/3632\">Improving Netflix Performance</a> at the <a href=\"http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/content/home\">Velocity Conference</a>.

When the BODY finishes rendering, it will execute <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">F </span>and store the time stamp.<br /><br /><font style=\"font-weight:bold;\" size=\"4\">Capture End Time (\"to Done\")</font><br />Once <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">F</span> is finished however, this does mean that the page is completely rendered. In parallel, the browser has been loading CSS, Javascript, requesting images and rendering the page. But the page is not ready for the user to interact with (typically) until the <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">onload</span> event is finished for the page (see <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">G </span>in diagram below). <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thescottclan/2596664048/\" title=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-endtime.png (by billwscott)\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3170/2596664048_32e3c7a55b.jpg\" title=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-endtime.png (by billwscott)\" alt=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-endtime.png (by billwscott)\" height=\"278\" width=\"500\" /></a><br /><br />We attempt to insert our instrumentation as the very last item to be handled in the onload event for the page.<br /><br /><font size=\"4\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Logging the Captured Times</span></font><br />Here is a diagram that shows the various time points we capture (8) and the measures we derive (5).<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thescottclan/2595821783/\" title=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-alltimes.png (by billwscott)\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3109/2595821783_6d425a634a.jpg\" title=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-alltimes.png (by billwscott)\" alt=\"roundtrip-blog-capture-alltimes.png (by billwscott)\" height=\"352\" width=\"500\" /></a><br /><br />The five measurements are:<br /><ul><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Elapsed client request time</span> (G-A). Full cycle time. The total time it took to request the page, receive the response and render the page. Not available if the referring page is not a Netflix page. This is not available for all measurements.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Elapsed server response</span> (E-B). How much time was spent generating the server response.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Elapsed client render</span> (G-D). How much time it took the client to render the page (and get the server response). Since we stream our response to the client, there's no way to differentiate how much of the client rendering time was spent getting the response from the server vs. rendering the page. The browser will start to render the page as it receives the content from the server.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Elapsed server plus client</span> (C-B) + (G-D). Total time to render; full time to generate the response and render it client-side. This is the key measure we use as it includes the most reliable start time (that we can capture all the time). It is the summation of the client render time (G-D) and the elapsed server response (C-B). By taking the deltas on the client and the server separately we can safely add their values together to get a total time (even though they are captured in different server clock times). The caveat is there can be some gap between the time C emits the HEAD tag and the corresponding Javascript time stamp and the time D starts rendering. In practice we have found this time to be sufficiently small on the whole so have kept to this simple approach.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Elapsed  client render after body</span> (G-F). This gives us an idea of how much additional time is needed to get the page fully loaded after rendering the body.<br /></li></ul>At this point we can gather up the five values (persisted so far via server-side and client-side cookies or some other methodology) and write these out to a server log. This could be done via an Ajax call, using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bug\">beacons</a>, an <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/print/no-refresh-links\">HTTP request with a NO-CONTENT </a>response or some other mechanism. The back end service caches up results and writes them to a database for later analysis.<br /><br /><font style=\"font-weight:bold;\" size=\"4\">The Benefit of Measuring</font><br />We could have chosen to implement all the yslow <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/index.html#rules\">performance suggestions</a> without measuring anything. Most likely they would all be wins for us. But by putting a full user experience performance tracing mechanism in place we can be confident that enhancements, features, or even attempts at performance improvement did not negatively affect site performance.<br /><br />Recently we fielded a different variation of our star ratings widget. While it cut the number of HTTP requests in half for large Queue pages (a good thing) it actually degraded performance. Having real time performance data let us narrow down on the culprit. This feedback loops is an excellent learning tool for performance. With our significant customer base, large number of daily page hits we can get a really reliable read on the performance our users are experiencing. As a side note, the <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">median</span> is the best way to summarize our measurements as it nicely takes care of the outliers (think of the widely varying bandwidths, different browser performance profiles that can all affect measurements.)<br /><br /><font style=\"font-weight:bold;\" size=\"4\">In future articles </font><br /><ul><li>Discuss what has worked and not worked.</li><li>Discuss an internal firebug extension I wrote to visualize this data for our developers.</li><li>Compare Safari vs Firefox vs IE -- the results are really interesting.</li><li>Announce a new Firebug Extension that helps visualize performance page data.</li></ul><font style=\"font-weight:bold;\" size=\"4\">Hear More About this at the Velocity Conference</font><br />As I mentioned in my previous article I will be giving a 15 minute talk on <a href=\"http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/schedule/detail/3632\">Improving Netflix Performance</a> at the <a href=\"http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/content/home\">Velocity Conference</a>.

I was fortunate to attend &amp; participate on a panel at WebVisions in 2006. I found it to be a no-hype, practical conference with good speakers and excellent attendees. And of course Portland is a wonderful city.<br /><br />Designing with Patterns Workshop<br />I will be giving a 3 hour workshop on Wednesday afternoon (May 20) starting at 2pm. Here is the planned agenda:<br /><ul><li>Pattern Overview</li><li>Survey of Pattern Libraries</li><li>Design Principles</li><li>Principle One: Make it Direct</li><li>Exercise: It's a Drag</li><li>Present Solutions</li><li>Principle Two: Keep it Lightweight</li><li>Principle Three: Stay on the Page</li><li>Principle Four: Provide an Invitation</li><li>Principle Five: Use Transitions</li><li>Principle Six: React Immediately</li><li>Exercise 2: Button Mayhem</li><li>Present Solutions</li><li>Q &amp; A</li></ul>Here is a description of the workshop.<br /><blockquote><br />In every field of design one of the first things students must do is learn from the work of others. They study and break down real-world examples in order to understand the underlying principles and patterns that make for successful design. Then they are able to apply these learnings to their own set of problems. Designing for web interfaces is no different. We are constantly searching for inspiration and practical guidance in solving the problems we face as designers each day. One approach to curating and applying solutions is through the idea of design patterns. Design patterns define a solution in the context of a real world problem.<br /><br />In this workshop, Bill Scott will discuss the rationale behind patterns, present a number of excellent pattern libraries for your consideration (20+), and then dive deep into 100+ examples from around the web that illustrate good interaction techniques (design patterns) as well as the not so good (anti-patterns) all organized as a set of six design principles. The main idea of the workshop is to expose you to lots and lots of real world examples and discuss the nuances and best practices that can be distilled from the them. In addition there will be time for two group exercises -- both actual problems that are currently being worked on at Netflix.<br /></blockquote><br />Many patterns are discussed. Here are the main ones:<br /><br /><img src=\"http://billwscott.com/files/pattern-visual.png\" alt=\"In Page Editing. Direct Selection. Drag and Drop. Complex Inline Editing. Alternate Edit Path.

I was fortunate to attend &amp; participate on a panel at WebVisions in 2006. I found it to be a no-hype, practical conference with good speakers and excellent attendees. And of course Portland is a wonderful city.<br /><br />Designing with Patterns Workshop<br />I will be giving a 3 hour workshop on Wednesday afternoon (May 20) starting at 2pm. Here is the planned agenda:<br /><ul><li>Pattern Overview</li><li>Survey of Pattern Libraries</li><li>Design Principles</li><li>Principle One: Make it Direct</li><li>Exercise: It's a Drag</li><li>Present Solutions</li><li>Principle Two: Keep it Lightweight</li><li>Principle Three: Stay on the Page</li><li>Principle Four: Provide an Invitation</li><li>Principle Five: Use Transitions</li><li>Principle Six: React Immediately</li><li>Exercise 2: Button Mayhem</li><li>Present Solutions</li><li>Q &amp; A</li></ul>Here is a description of the workshop.<br /><blockquote><br />In every field of design one of the first things students must do is learn from the work of others. They study and break down real-world examples in order to understand the underlying principles and patterns that make for successful design. Then they are able to apply these learnings to their own set of problems. Designing for web interfaces is no different. We are constantly searching for inspiration and practical guidance in solving the problems we face as designers each day. One approach to curating and applying solutions is through the idea of design patterns. Design patterns define a solution in the context of a real world problem.<br /><br />In this workshop, Bill Scott will discuss the rationale behind patterns, present a number of excellent pattern libraries for your consideration (20+), and then dive deep into 100+ examples from around the web that illustrate good interaction techniques (design patterns) as well as the not so good (anti-patterns) all organized as a set of six design principles. The main idea of the workshop is to expose you to lots and lots of real world examples and discuss the nuances and best practices that can be distilled from the them. In addition there will be time for two group exercises -- both actual problems that are currently being worked on at Netflix.<br /></blockquote><br />Many patterns are discussed. Here are the main ones:<br /><br /><img src=\"http://billwscott.com/files/pattern-visual.png\" alt=\"In Page Editing. Direct Selection. Drag and Drop. Complex Inline Editing. Alternate Edit Path.

Maybe if it had been a finger on the \"button\" I would have gotten the sequence: foot on brake, finger on button.<br /><br />Ok, so now that I know the magic sequence, keyless ignition is cool. In my everyday experience it is much better than keyed ignition. Just hop in the car with \"key\" in my pocket, put my foot on the brake and push the button -- awesome! Normally a car salesman would have happily explained it to me. But in the Avis parking garage I had no car manual nor anyone explaining the process.<br /><br />My experience figuring it out was very frustrating. Yet the everyday experience was not.

And it had nothing to do with putting your foot on the brake. This you see is not an <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">intuitive</span> interface. It is what Alan Cooper calls an <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">idiomatic</span> interface.<br /><br />In Cooper's book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470084111?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=looksgoodwork-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0470084111\">About Face 3</a> he describes three types of interfaces: <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">instinctive</span>, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">intuitive</span> and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">idiomatic</span> (pp 273-275). <br /><br />An example of an instinctive interface is when you can't keep your eyes off of the dancing cowboys in the ubiquitous mortgage ads. Your brain is hard-wired for attention processing. <br /><br />An intuitive interface is one that utilizes the brains ability to do a mental comparison between familiar experiences and a new one. An example might be guessing what the trash can icon on a desktop does since you already understand a real world trash can. Putting items in it would throw them away. <br /><br />But getting items into the trash can may not be something you could intuit without being shown drag and drop. This is the last type -- idiomatic. Idiomatic interfaces are what make up most user interfaces. Scroll bars, nested folders, radio buttons, drag and drop are not instinctive or immediately intuitive. Instead you have to learn how to use them (yes there is a gray line between intuitive &amp; idiomatic). In the original Mac the shortcut for ejecting a disk was to drag it to the trashcan. Not intuitive and not instinctive, but idiomatic. Like learning the idiom \"beat around the bush\" once it is learned it is easy to use in common speech. Ejecting a disk by dragging to the trash can was a nice shortcut (before the mac had right click menus). <br /><br />Once I was shown this idiom I did not forget it.<br /><br />Another example of an idiomatic interface is the iPhone's ability to move items around. You hold your finger down for a second or so on the icons on the home screen. They get jiggly. Then you can drag them around. Totally not intuitive. But idiomatic. Once learned it is easy to do.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/designingwebinterfaces/3121410556/\" title=\"dwi_0113b by Designing Web Interfaces, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3235/3121410556_a3e2835ee1_m.jpg\" alt=\"dwi_0113b\" width=\"240\" height=\"164\" /></a><br /><br />So back to the keyless ignition. This is an example of an idiomatic interface. Not intuitive. Why the brake + the button? Why not just the button? I am guessing this keeps the kiddos from starting the car up. Also guessing the seat requires someone sitting in it before the brake + button would even work -- all safety features. But even though it was not intuitive it was learn-able. And as with all good idiomatic interfaces once I learned it the interface was simple.<br /><br />Alan Cooper states it this way:<br /><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">All idioms must be learned; Good idioms need to be learned only once.</span>","html":"<p>When my wife &amp; I arrived in Seattle recently, we rented a car from Avis.

Lorna Borenstein had taken over the helms as President (I worked with her on Yahoo! for Teachers and know her passion for a good UX).<br /><br />However, there is a small complaint I have. And it has to do with the lowly hyperlink.<br /><br />If you search for real estate you will get a list view back by default. Notice the title is the address and it is a hyperlink.

It has an underline and different color. Standard approach.</li><li>You are taken to the detail page when you click it.</li></ul>No surprise here. But there are other things you can do with this link.<br /><ul><li>You can right-click and copy the link's address.</li><li>You can add this link directly to your favorites bar in the browser window.</li><li>You can choose to open this link in a new tab/window.</li></ul>The last one is really nice.

Due to its completeness of data, ability to filter on many dimensions, easily expand search area I usually use <a href=\"http://Realtor.com\">Realtor.com</a>. This site has improved over the last 1.5 years since my former manager at Yahoo! Lorna Borenstein had taken over the helms as President (I worked with her on Yahoo! for Teachers and know her passion for a good UX).<br /><br />However, there is a small complaint I have. And it has to do with the lowly hyperlink.<br /><br />If you search for real estate you will get a list view back by default. Notice the title is the address and it is a hyperlink. So far so good.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/designingwebinterfaces/3921876052/\" title=\"realtor.com-simplelink-02 by Designing Web Interfaces, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3502/3921876052_8e81be6d8d.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"257\" alt=\"realtor.com-simplelink-02\" /></a><br /><br />You can see it is a legitimate hyperlink by the browser's status bar.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/designingwebinterfaces/3921876300/\" title=\"realtor.com-simplelink-06 by Designing Web Interfaces, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3530/3921876300_11827f9d13.jpg\" alt=\"realtor.com-simplelink-06\" width=\"500\" height=\"27\" /></a><br /><br />Here are some things you can do with a hyperlink.<br /><ul><li>You can tell where you will go if you click it (the address clues you a detail page for this house is the destination)</li><li>You can tell that you can click it. It has an underline and different color. Standard approach.</li><li>You are taken to the detail page when you click it.</li></ul>No surprise here. But there are other things you can do with this link.<br /><ul><li>You can right-click and copy the link's address.</li><li>You can add this link directly to your favorites bar in the browser window.</li><li>You can choose to open this link in a new tab/window.</li></ul>The last one is really nice.

With our site moving to the cloud, expanding into the international marketplace and our experience moving to multiple devices there are a number of challenges ahead. For this role you need to really understand cross-browser issues, know how to wield JavaScript and tame CSS to field numerous member experiences in our A/B testing framework. This is a senior role (as are all of the roles on my team). You will need to understand the principles of good, simple, clean design. As we continue to refactor the underlying infrastructure you will also need to be able to get your hands dirty in the Java/JSP layer as well. This means you can't just be an \"HTML hack\". No, you need to have a solid set of computer science skills.

I was really happy with the positive feedback.<br /><br />Here are the slides from last night.<br /><br /><div style=\"width:425px;\" id=\"__ss_3663620\"><strong style=\"display:block;margin:12px 0 4px;\"><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/billwscott/designing-with-lenses-chifoo\" title=\"Designing With Lenses - CHIFOO\">Designing With Lenses - CHIFOO</a></strong><div style=\"padding:5px 0 12px;\">View more <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/\">presentations</a> from <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/billwscott\">Bill Scott</a>.</div></div><br />The biggest takeaways for me were:<br /><div><ul><li>The idea of lenses is a great way to mentally frame design principles</li><li>There is a strong interest in us curating these principles</li><li>There is still some tinkering on how broad the lenses should be (lumping vs. splitting). The analogy of a camera lens was used by <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/annmarcus\">Ann Marcus</a>. Narrow the lens and get the details but lose more of the context. Widen and you get less detail but a broader application.</li><li>That lenses can serve (as patterns do) to inform not just designers but all involved in product design as a common vocabulary and repository for examples.</li></ul><div>Let me know what you think. </div><div><br /></div><div>You can follow the lens project on the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/uxlenses\">@uxlenses</a> twitter feed.

I no longer could be involved in the details as my group spanned every part of the Netflix business. It was a fantastic position -- really a dream job. But at the end of the day I needed to be more a part of the solution.<br /><br />So I left Netflix and became the VP of Engineering &amp; UX at Meebo. Meebo is really a stellar place. But after just a couple of months I realized I had moved in the wrong direction. And it became clear to me that all of the positions opening to me where at a level that mostly dealt with the organizational challenges with some limited high level strategy.

Instead of leading all of the user interface engineers at Netflix, I am leading a smaller (but growing team) that is focused on solving specific problems on the marketing/customer acquisition/account side of the house. The cool thing is the solutions our team fields directly impact the growth of Netflix &amp; the dollars that come in the door. Plus I am able to get much more involved in the day to day work of the product.<br /><br />The bottom line: My recommendation couldn't be stronger for coming to Netflix.

Couple this with what is to come in offline payments (POS, mobile, tablet, etc.) and the huge resources of eBay as the parent company and I was sold on PayPal as the company.<br /><br /><b>Why this role?</b><br />While PayPal has all this goodness, they felt strongly that one thing they needed was a strong Web UI leader who could help define a nimble, open source based UI architecture, who could help bring design &amp; engineering together, who could help simplify the process of getting design to life and who could attract top UI talent to the organization. That is a tall order. But as we talked about this role and my background we felt it was the right match. And just 2 weeks after the initial conversations I accepted the role as Sr. Director of Web Development.<br /><br />Looking back at my career the most successful &amp; enjoyable times for me have been when I am in the role of influencer or change agent. Back at Sabre I was able to found the common web &amp; desktop UI engineering teams as well as the UX design team and influence many of the core products.

I graduated with a computer science degree and was taught the value and beauty of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling\">loosely coupled</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(programming)\">modular code</a> with a clear <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\">separation of concerns</a>. In fact some of my most rewarding experiences have been writing user interface frameworks (a few dozen over the last 30 years).<br /><br />The same goes for designing experiences. Early on I realized that interaction designs could also be reused. Sometime after reading the gang of four book (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=looksgoodwork-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0201633612\">Design Patterns</a>) I started thinking that patterns could be used to define experiences as well. It was after that I stumbled upon Jennifer Tidwell's excellent work which would later become the book <a href=\"http://designinginterfaces.com/\">Designing Interfaces</a>. A few years later, I went on to help launch the <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/\">Yahoo! Design Pattern library</a> and write a <a href=\"http://designingwebinterfaces.com/\">book</a> on the subject.<br /><br />I mention all this to set the context that I am a huge fan of reuse.<br /><h2>Designing for Throwaway-ability</h2>In my prior role at Netflix, I quickly discovered a wrinkle to the reuse mantra. If you know a little about Netflix you will know that experimentation is the bread and butter of refining the experiences there. The big \"aha!\" moment came (2008) when I counted the number of experiments we fielded vs the number of experiments that became a lasting part of the site. I discovered that<br /><br /><em>Only about 10% of the UI code written to craft the experience lasted more than a year. 90% of the UI code needed to be thrown away.</em><br /><br />Could that really be right? In some cases we were testing 10+ test cells over a couple of months time. Only 1 cell (or sometimes a combination of cells) was selected as a winner. The winning cells often led to a new hypothesis that led to another set of test cells being fielded (perhaps another 10+ cells). And of those a new cell (or control) would end up as the winner. It doesn't take too many 9 out of 10 losers to start seeing that a lot of code needed to be thrown away over the course of a year. (I am over-simplifying this a bit. There is often reuse between test cells as well as the number of cells fielded will vary.)<br /><br />Now to a typical user the experience doesn't seem to change much in the short term. User A might be in a control cell (the standard experience). And in the next set of tests User A might still get allocated to the standard experience again. So to User A the site seems pretty stable. However if you plot the arc of the experience year over year you will see some substantial changes occur (think: Amazon, Netflix, Twitter, Facebook) as newly minted experiences are released to the full user population.<br /><br />The epiphany for me was that for the most volatile part of the experience...<br /><br /><em>We needed to design for throwaway-ability and not as much for reusability.</em><br /><br />What does that even mean? Design for throwaway-ability? It means not over-investing in the scaffolding for reuse. It means designing a way to select code for experiments in a simple grokkable manner (like using the file system or packaging mechanisms for bundling experiments together). It means externalizing the logic for selecting experiments as much as possible. It might even mean copy and paste reuse to make it easy to modularize the experiments. It means don't start with writing components, instead start with creating the experience.<br /><h2>Heresy!</h2>When I had this epiphany it certainly felt heretical. Over time I have come to see the wisdom of knowing when to reuse and when not to reuse. However, lest I be next for a good stake burning for giving others a license to writing crappy code (since one could argue that it will be thrown away anyway ;-) let me provide some nuance.<br /><h2>Reuse is Still a Good Thing</h2>Not all of the UI layer changes with experimentation. The nuance is the UI layer contains different levels of volatility. The code to make a button or render a template doesn't change with an experiment. However, the placement of the button or the contents of the template will often vary from test to test.<br /><br />For the more stable areas of the experience, the great news is we have a rich set of open source libraries and frameworks that can provide a lot of this reuse right out of the box. Examples include component libraries like <a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/\">YUI</a> or <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a>; templating solutions like <a href=\"http://mustache.github.com/\">mustache</a> or <a href=\"http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/\">dust</a>; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\">MVC</a> patterns like those expressed in <a href=\"http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/\">backbone.js</a>; common javascript extensions like those found in <a href=\"http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/\">underscore.js</a> and so on. In addition each organization will find certain aspects of their user experience that benefit heavily from thoughtful reuse.<br /><br />The truth is volatility increases as you get closer to the user experience and reuse opportunities increase as you move down the software stack.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://billwscott.com/files/volatility-stack.png\" style=\"margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"152\" src=\"http://billwscott.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/volatility-stack.png?w=300\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>This funnel illustrates the relationship of volatility and reuse </i></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>as you move up and down the software stack.</i></div><h2>UI Layer = Experimentation Layer</h2>What I want to impress upon you is a simple thought.<br /><br /><em>The UI layer should be thought of as the experimentation layer</em><br /><br />Think of the topmost layer of the user interface code (especially the HTML, CSS and Javascript for experiments) as the experimentation layer. As a corollary<br /><br /><em>You should always create an experience before thinking about creating a component </em><br /><br />In other words seek to use before reuse. I have found in my conversations at PayPal, talking about the UI layer as an experimentation layer is a great way to shift the conversation to the experience rather than to spending months building components and interface scaffolding. The goal is to get code in front of the user as fast as possible. Instead of starting with reuse, we start with the experience.<br /><h2>What about Consistency?</h2>Now let's be clear, experimentation is not the silver bullet that will create the perfect experience. A lot of understanding about the user, scenarios, and just good solid design principles are needed to make a good start on the experience. Experimentation can often lead to local optima instead of finding the overall experience. But given a good experience, experimentation can allow you to refine the experience in the right direction.<br /><br />One of the valid complaints that designers will often raise about experimentation is that it can lead to different experiences across the product families as the experimentation often is chasing specific business metrics in a specific area of the business. This can lead to some inconsistency when we allow the experience to be experimented on (at Netflix we call this the Frankenstein phase). There is a natural tension between innovation and standardization and the truth is healthy products will swing back and forth between loosening the constraints and innovating and then pulling back in the reigns and standardizing.<br /><br />Design standardization (read: patterns, guidelines) can be used to bring consistency. But I have often seen design standards teams position themselves at odds to innovation. And on the converse I have seen design innovation teams totally ignore basic patterns that could be employed. Both are wrong. Consistency without informed learnings during phases of innovation is the dead letter. And innovation without the learnings of the past &amp; best practices is just wild speculation.<br /><br />Engineering teams will struggle with when to invest in the reuse scaffolding and when to simply create an experience that is quick to build and quick to tear down.<br /><h2>The Bottom Line</h2>The key thing to remember is everything must be in service to the user's experience. It's way to easy to forget this and get in an endless cycles of finessing the UI - which I must remind you might not even be the right experience.<br /><br /></div>","html":"<p>em {  font-weight:bold;  font-size:14px; }  <div style=\"margin:0;\"><h2>Designing for Reusability</h2><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse\">Code reuse</a> has been a major concern of mine throughout my career.

It was after that I stumbled upon Jennifer Tidwell's excellent work which would later become the book <a href=\"http://designinginterfaces.com/\">Designing Interfaces</a>. A few years later, I went on to help launch the <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/\">Yahoo! Design Pattern library</a> and write a <a href=\"http://designingwebinterfaces.com/\">book</a> on the subject.<br /><br />I mention all this to set the context that I am a huge fan of reuse.<br /><h2>Designing for Throwaway-ability</h2>In my prior role at Netflix, I quickly discovered a wrinkle to the reuse mantra. If you know a little about Netflix you will know that experimentation is the bread and butter of refining the experiences there. The big \"aha!\" moment came (2008) when I counted the number of experiments we fielded vs the number of experiments that became a lasting part of the site. I discovered that<br /><br /><em>Only about 10% of the UI code written to craft the experience lasted more than a year. 90% of the UI code needed to be thrown away.</em><br /><br />Could that really be right? In some cases we were testing 10+ test cells over a couple of months time. Only 1 cell (or sometimes a combination of cells) was selected as a winner. The winning cells often led to a new hypothesis that led to another set of test cells being fielded (perhaps another 10+ cells). And of those a new cell (or control) would end up as the winner. It doesn't take too many 9 out of 10 losers to start seeing that a lot of code needed to be thrown away over the course of a year. (I am over-simplifying this a bit. There is often reuse between test cells as well as the number of cells fielded will vary.)<br /><br />Now to a typical user the experience doesn't seem to change much in the short term. User A might be in a control cell (the standard experience). And in the next set of tests User A might still get allocated to the standard experience again. So to User A the site seems pretty stable. However if you plot the arc of the experience year over year you will see some substantial changes occur (think: Amazon, Netflix, Twitter, Facebook) as newly minted experiences are released to the full user population.<br /><br />The epiphany for me was that for the most volatile part of the experience...<br /><br /><em>We needed to design for throwaway-ability and not as much for reusability.</em><br /><br />What does that even mean? Design for throwaway-ability? It means not over-investing in the scaffolding for reuse. It means designing a way to select code for experiments in a simple grokkable manner (like using the file system or packaging mechanisms for bundling experiments together). It means externalizing the logic for selecting experiments as much as possible. It might even mean copy and paste reuse to make it easy to modularize the experiments. It means don't start with writing components, instead start with creating the experience.<br /><h2>Heresy!</h2>When I had this epiphany it certainly felt heretical. Over time I have come to see the wisdom of knowing when to reuse and when not to reuse. However, lest I be next for a good stake burning for giving others a license to writing crappy code (since one could argue that it will be thrown away anyway ;-) let me provide some nuance.<br /><h2>Reuse is Still a Good Thing</h2>Not all of the UI layer changes with experimentation. The nuance is the UI layer contains different levels of volatility. The code to make a button or render a template doesn't change with an experiment. However, the placement of the button or the contents of the template will often vary from test to test.<br /><br />For the more stable areas of the experience, the great news is we have a rich set of open source libraries and frameworks that can provide a lot of this reuse right out of the box. Examples include component libraries like <a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/\">YUI</a> or <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a>; templating solutions like <a href=\"http://mustache.github.com/\">mustache</a> or <a href=\"http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/\">dust</a>; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\">MVC</a> patterns like those expressed in <a href=\"http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/\">backbone.js</a>; common javascript extensions like those found in <a href=\"http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/\">underscore.js</a> and so on. In addition each organization will find certain aspects of their user experience that benefit heavily from thoughtful reuse.<br /><br />The truth is volatility increases as you get closer to the user experience and reuse opportunities increase as you move down the software stack.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://billwscott.com/files/volatility-stack.png\" style=\"margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"152\" src=\"http://billwscott.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/volatility-stack.png?w=300\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>This funnel illustrates the relationship of volatility and reuse </i></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>as you move up and down the software stack.</i></div><h2>UI Layer = Experimentation Layer</h2>What I want to impress upon you is a simple thought.<br /><br /><em>The UI layer should be thought of as the experimentation layer</em><br /><br />Think of the topmost layer of the user interface code (especially the HTML, CSS and Javascript for experiments) as the experimentation layer. As a corollary<br /><br /><em>You should always create an experience before thinking about creating a component </em><br /><br />In other words seek to use before reuse. I have found in my conversations at PayPal, talking about the UI layer as an experimentation layer is a great way to shift the conversation to the experience rather than to spending months building components and interface scaffolding. The goal is to get code in front of the user as fast as possible. Instead of starting with reuse, we start with the experience.<br /><h2>What about Consistency?</h2>Now let's be clear, experimentation is not the silver bullet that will create the perfect experience. A lot of understanding about the user, scenarios, and just good solid design principles are needed to make a good start on the experience. Experimentation can often lead to local optima instead of finding the overall experience. But given a good experience, experimentation can allow you to refine the experience in the right direction.<br /><br />One of the valid complaints that designers will often raise about experimentation is that it can lead to different experiences across the product families as the experimentation often is chasing specific business metrics in a specific area of the business. This can lead to some inconsistency when we allow the experience to be experimented on (at Netflix we call this the Frankenstein phase). There is a natural tension between innovation and standardization and the truth is healthy products will swing back and forth between loosening the constraints and innovating and then pulling back in the reigns and standardizing.<br /><br />Design standardization (read: patterns, guidelines) can be used to bring consistency. But I have often seen design standards teams position themselves at odds to innovation. And on the converse I have seen design innovation teams totally ignore basic patterns that could be employed. Both are wrong. Consistency without informed learnings during phases of innovation is the dead letter. And innovation without the learnings of the past &amp; best practices is just wild speculation.<br /><br />Engineering teams will struggle with when to invest in the reuse scaffolding and when to simply create an experience that is quick to build and quick to tear down.<br /><h2>The Bottom Line</h2>The key thing to remember is everything must be in service to the user's experience. It's way to easy to forget this and get in an endless cycles of finessing the UI - which I must remind you might not even be the right experience.<br /><br /></div></p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2013-12-24T03:12:50.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2013-12-24T03:12:50.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2012-04-23T03:22:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":190,"uuid":"7971fa6d-50a1-475a-b46c-6dabc16a8d29","title":"Anti-Patterns for Lean UX","slug":"anti-patterns-for-lean-ux","markdown":"We are going full bore on LeanUX at PayPal.

Today I want to talk about why you should come to PayPal to work with me.<br /><br />To start with let's be frank. Last year when I contemplated joining PayPal it was clear PayPal had long lost its luster as the darling innovator of Silicon Valley. PayPal had changed the face of payments when it came on the scene. And the innovators DNA is evidenced by one of its founders going on to create the first viable electric car and the successor to the Space Shuttle program. To get a fuller look at the innovator DNA of early PayPal, check out the wikipedia article on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia\" target=\"_blank\">PayPal Mafia</a>.<br /><br />But what I sensed when I joined PayPal last October was a desire to get back to its innovation roots. Back to a desire to innovate again. This desire coupled with a very healthy financial position seemed to me to be a no brainer. I decided to take the chance. So what has happened in the past 10 months? From my perspective three things: New leadership, new way of working and new talent.<br /><br /><h3>New Leadership</h3>How often do companies the size and age of PayPal get a complete makeover? Not often. But that is just what has been underway here. Take a look at just some of the new leadership in the company:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/dmarcus\" target=\"_blank\">David Marcus</a>. President. David came into PayPal a year ago as part of the <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/zong\" target=\"_blank\">Zong</a> (mobile payments) acquisition. David is a product, user experience, social &amp; mobile guy at heart. He is passionate about innovation and his motto is GSD (Get sh*t done!). Before PayPal I believe the largest organization he led was 200 people (Zong). He believes in small teams empowered with really smart people working with great business context. I could not be happier than I am working at PayPal with David at the helm.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesbarrese\" target=\"_blank\">James Barrese</a>. James became the CTO of PayPal earlier this year. James brings the challenge to think differently to the technology organization. James also brings a wealth of experience leading technology at eBay with lessons learned from what worked and what didn't. </li><li><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/hillferguson\" target=\"_blank\">Hill Ferguson</a>. Head of Product &amp; Mobile. Hill also joined PayPal through the Zong acquisition. Hill has strong mobile &amp; financial roots and is a passionate leader bringing together all of our product &amp; mobile teams together in a single team.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/hendrik-kleinsmiede/0/62a/840\" target=\"_blank\">Hendrik Kleinsmiede</a>. VP of Global Design (UED). Hendrik joined in January and brings with him a passion to create great experiences by attracting top talent and collaborating deeply with product &amp; engineering. Hendrik &amp; I have a very close working relationship and in our short time have collaborated on bringing LeanUX and Mobile First thinking in as first class citizens of PayPal.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/kirstenwolberg\" target=\"_blank\">Kirsten Wolberg</a>. VP Technical Business Office (Project Management). Kirsten believes in Agile approach through &amp; through having led the Salesforce IT org to become agile there. I am working in a team with Kirsten to make working in small teams a reality across PayPal.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/allen-olivo/0/6b/89a\" target=\"_blank\">Allen Olivo</a>. Head of Global Marketing. Allen is a luminary in the industry having led Apple during the Steve Jobs transition back in the fold. He has places like Amazon &amp; Yahoo in his past as well. Like the new fresh PayPal look? That is Allen &amp; his team.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.crockford.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Doug Crockford</a>. JavaScript Architect &amp; Industry Luminary! Need I say more?</li></ul><div>This is not an exhaustive list. I am sure I am forgetting to mention someone. I could also make a much longer list of VPs, Sr. Directors and Directors that have joined in the last year bringing fresh perspectives into the company. But I should mention that there are many existing leaders (like my former boss who recruited me) that also have this DNA of change.</div><br /><h3>New Way of Working</h3>I have mentioned before that PayPal is in the midst of a transformation from working in silos in a slow waterfall manner to a lean, startup approach. Earlier in the year I had the privilege of helping to kick off a new way of working on a core part of our business. We took <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307887898&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=looksgoodwork-20\" target=\"_blank\">lessons from startups</a> and decided that going forward (this was with David's total blessing as well as mandate) we would not work the way we had in the past.<br /><br />We gathered our designers, our product folks and our engineers and took over a few conference rooms and began to operate like a startup. Design was done on whiteboards and coded in real time. Usability tests were weekly so the pace was fast and furious. But we were able to try dozens of experiences across desktop, tablet and mobile in the time that would have taken years at PayPal before. Build/Test/Learn became our mantra.<br /><br />To date we have trained several hundred designers, engineers, product, QA, and other employees in <a href=\"http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/07/lean-ux-getting-out-of-the-deliverables-business/\" target=\"_blank\">Lean UX methodologies</a>. In addition, we are in a huge transformation project bringing more and more of PayPal into this mode of working every day. Currently I am involved in at least 6 new innovation projects all operating like a startup within the company.<br /><br />You can read about this approach in my presentation on the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/billwscott/the-lean-tech-stack\" target=\"_blank\">Lean UI Stack</a> as well as see my cautions for what can go wrong in the presentation <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/billwscott/lean-ux-antipatterns\" target=\"_blank\">Anti-Patterns for LeanUX</a>.<br /><br /><h3>New Technology Stack </h3>I am really excited about this part of the transformation. For years PayPal's UI has been built on top of XML/XSLT technologies. If you know me you will no doubt have heard me rant violently about how this technology is the bane of good UI engineering. I won't go into it here, but suffice it to say that the only thing worse than XML/XSLT is a proprietary form of XML/XSLT -- which of course is what PayPal was built on (C++ on the backend).<br /><br />In the last year the company has moved to Java for all new projects. I am very comfortable with Java. In fact since 1996 I have personally built 4 UI frameworks on top of the Java stack. However, I long ago lost my excitement for using Java in any way, shape or form for the experience layer. Typically Java Server Pages (JSP) is the standard Java solution for UIs. And not very surprisingly this is exactly what was in flight when I joined PayPal.<br /><br />Knowing that Java was an improvement over C++ and JSP was an improvement over XML/XSLT wasn't enough to satisfy my requirement that UI Engineering (UIE) needed to be able to \"Bring great design to life quickly\". Elsewhere I have written about how the <a href=\"the-experimentation-layer\" target=\"_blank\">UI layer is actually the experimentation layer</a>. And that you must design for build/test/learn. Which means designing for volatility and throwaway-ability. Iterating in Java and JSPs just didn't cut it based on my experience.<br /><br />So with the launch of the new \"startup\" for one of our core businesses we began to experiment with <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">nodejs</a>. Node is an extremely powerful development environment for applications. <a href=\"https://npmjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Many node modules</a> exist to bootstrap an application. And coupled with the right stack on the UI layer we saw it as a winning combination.<br /><br />We wanted to be able to iterate faster than we could with the JSP stack and we wanted to be able to bring new talent in the door and have them checking in code within the first few days of hiring. In our mind this was only possible by using open source software as much as possible. Here are some of the choices we made at the UI layer:<br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/\" target=\"_blank\">Dust JS</a> for our templating. We are partnering with <a href=\"http://engineering.linkedin.com/frontend/leaving-jsps-dust-moving-linkedin-dustjs-client-side-templates\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a> as well as contributing to their fork of the <a href=\"https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs\" target=\"_blank\">Dust JS code on github</a>. Dust is great because it compiles down to JS and so the same templates can be run in the server as well as in the client (page-oriented vs applications).</li><li><a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Backbone JS</a> for eventing/model/structure to our applications. Of course <a href=\"http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/\" target=\"_blank\">underscore JS</a> comes along for the ride.</li><li><a href=\"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Bootstrap</a>. For our components. Very nice.</li><li><a href=\"http://jquery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jQuery</a>. Naturally.</li><li>For mobile: <a href=\"http://www.jqmobi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jQMobi</a>. Although we are continually re-evaluating choices here.</li><li><a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Less</a>. For CSS pre-processing. </li><li><a href=\"http://requirejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Require JS</a>. For module discipline, dependency management, packaging and minification.</li></ul><br />However, we were faced with a dilemma. PayPal had invested significantly in the Java layer. It was easy enough to develop with these UI technologies on top of node. But what about the Java/Spring foundation below?<br /><br />What we did was a rather elegant hack. We added a new ViewResolver in Spring to handle running Dust templates within the Java server stack. We use RhinoScript as the resolver since it is the JS execution engine for the Java VM world.<br /><br />On the node side, we continued to use it for all of our mockup/prototyping of the actual product. The UI stack sits nicely on top of this node stack. And at anytime we just push the UI portion of the app over to the production Java stack and it runs the same as it did in node. In effect we have made our UI prototyping code be the same as our UI production code.<br /><br />We continue to investigate the feasibility of using Node in production and working with our PayPal infrastructure team are continuously adding modules to Node to have it operate as a first class citizen in the PayPal environment. In addition, the team has built a node bootstrap that allows you to gen up applications, views, controllers for our node apps -- a lot like the Rails scaffolding.<br /><br />Another great change internally has been the addition of GitHub to our full enterprise. Nothing like having GitHub as your blessed code repository. All of our node code lives there so the whole org is can make it better.<br /><br />What has been the result?<br /><br /><ul><li>New UI Engineer hired and within 4 hours was checking in code! PayPal record as far as I know.</li><li>\"Coding is fun again\" -- quote from UIE after working in our new  tech stack.</li><li>Spun up half-dozen new projects behaving like startups using the new technology stack with very little training (if you can google it you don't need a week-long class to teach it).</li><li>Innovation is happening. We are seeing high levels of collaboration and continuous build/test/learn cycles happening in multiple teams.</li></ul><br /><h3>New Talent</h3>Last but not least is the talent. I was pleasantly pleased to find good to great talent within PayPal when I joined. Two top engineers at Netflix joined my team and are leading out on a lot of the innovation. The existing members are actually folks I sought out to work for me before and are doing excellent work. I have hired great talent from Yahoo! as well as other places and am looking to deepen the talent further. But I don't want to stop there. I am looking for talent density within my organization and across PayPal.<br /><br />What about you? If you are a top-flight UIE (frontend engineer, web developer, etc) and it jazzes you to imagine the change we can bring with the resources of PayPal focused correctly, then why not drop me a line. I always have room for top talent.

Build/Test/Learn became our mantra.<br /><br />To date we have trained several hundred designers, engineers, product, QA, and other employees in <a href=\"http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/07/lean-ux-getting-out-of-the-deliverables-business/\" target=\"_blank\">Lean UX methodologies</a>. In addition, we are in a huge transformation project bringing more and more of PayPal into this mode of working every day. Currently I am involved in at least 6 new innovation projects all operating like a startup within the company.<br /><br />You can read about this approach in my presentation on the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/billwscott/the-lean-tech-stack\" target=\"_blank\">Lean UI Stack</a> as well as see my cautions for what can go wrong in the presentation <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/billwscott/lean-ux-antipatterns\" target=\"_blank\">Anti-Patterns for LeanUX</a>.<br /><br /><h3>New Technology Stack </h3>I am really excited about this part of the transformation. For years PayPal's UI has been built on top of XML/XSLT technologies. If you know me you will no doubt have heard me rant violently about how this technology is the bane of good UI engineering. I won't go into it here, but suffice it to say that the only thing worse than XML/XSLT is a proprietary form of XML/XSLT -- which of course is what PayPal was built on (C++ on the backend).<br /><br />In the last year the company has moved to Java for all new projects. I am very comfortable with Java. In fact since 1996 I have personally built 4 UI frameworks on top of the Java stack. However, I long ago lost my excitement for using Java in any way, shape or form for the experience layer. Typically Java Server Pages (JSP) is the standard Java solution for UIs. And not very surprisingly this is exactly what was in flight when I joined PayPal.<br /><br />Knowing that Java was an improvement over C++ and JSP was an improvement over XML/XSLT wasn't enough to satisfy my requirement that UI Engineering (UIE) needed to be able to \"Bring great design to life quickly\". Elsewhere I have written about how the <a href=\"the-experimentation-layer\" target=\"_blank\">UI layer is actually the experimentation layer</a>. And that you must design for build/test/learn. Which means designing for volatility and throwaway-ability. Iterating in Java and JSPs just didn't cut it based on my experience.<br /><br />So with the launch of the new \"startup\" for one of our core businesses we began to experiment with <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">nodejs</a>. Node is an extremely powerful development environment for applications. <a href=\"https://npmjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Many node modules</a> exist to bootstrap an application. And coupled with the right stack on the UI layer we saw it as a winning combination.<br /><br />We wanted to be able to iterate faster than we could with the JSP stack and we wanted to be able to bring new talent in the door and have them checking in code within the first few days of hiring. In our mind this was only possible by using open source software as much as possible. Here are some of the choices we made at the UI layer:<br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/\" target=\"_blank\">Dust JS</a> for our templating. We are partnering with <a href=\"http://engineering.linkedin.com/frontend/leaving-jsps-dust-moving-linkedin-dustjs-client-side-templates\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a> as well as contributing to their fork of the <a href=\"https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs\" target=\"_blank\">Dust JS code on github</a>. Dust is great because it compiles down to JS and so the same templates can be run in the server as well as in the client (page-oriented vs applications).</li><li><a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Backbone JS</a> for eventing/model/structure to our applications. Of course <a href=\"http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/\" target=\"_blank\">underscore JS</a> comes along for the ride.</li><li><a href=\"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Bootstrap</a>. For our components. Very nice.</li><li><a href=\"http://jquery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jQuery</a>. Naturally.</li><li>For mobile: <a href=\"http://www.jqmobi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jQMobi</a>. Although we are continually re-evaluating choices here.</li><li><a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Less</a>. For CSS pre-processing. </li><li><a href=\"http://requirejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Require JS</a>. For module discipline, dependency management, packaging and minification.</li></ul><br />However, we were faced with a dilemma. PayPal had invested significantly in the Java layer. It was easy enough to develop with these UI technologies on top of node. But what about the Java/Spring foundation below?<br /><br />What we did was a rather elegant hack. We added a new ViewResolver in Spring to handle running Dust templates within the Java server stack. We use RhinoScript as the resolver since it is the JS execution engine for the Java VM world.<br /><br />On the node side, we continued to use it for all of our mockup/prototyping of the actual product. The UI stack sits nicely on top of this node stack. And at anytime we just push the UI portion of the app over to the production Java stack and it runs the same as it did in node. In effect we have made our UI prototyping code be the same as our UI production code.<br /><br />We continue to investigate the feasibility of using Node in production and working with our PayPal infrastructure team are continuously adding modules to Node to have it operate as a first class citizen in the PayPal environment. In addition, the team has built a node bootstrap that allows you to gen up applications, views, controllers for our node apps -- a lot like the Rails scaffolding.<br /><br />Another great change internally has been the addition of GitHub to our full enterprise. Nothing like having GitHub as your blessed code repository. All of our node code lives there so the whole org is can make it better.<br /><br />What has been the result?<br /><br /><ul><li>New UI Engineer hired and within 4 hours was checking in code! PayPal record as far as I know.</li><li>\"Coding is fun again\" -- quote from UIE after working in our new  tech stack.</li><li>Spun up half-dozen new projects behaving like startups using the new technology stack with very little training (if you can google it you don't need a week-long class to teach it).</li><li>Innovation is happening. We are seeing high levels of collaboration and continuous build/test/learn cycles happening in multiple teams.</li></ul><br /><h3>New Talent</h3>Last but not least is the talent. I was pleasantly pleased to find good to great talent within PayPal when I joined. Two top engineers at Netflix joined my team and are leading out on a lot of the innovation. The existing members are actually folks I sought out to work for me before and are doing excellent work. I have hired great talent from Yahoo! as well as other places and am looking to deepen the talent further. But I don't want to stop there. I am looking for talent density within my organization and across PayPal.<br /><br />What about you? If you are a top-flight UIE (frontend engineer, web developer, etc) and it jazzes you to imagine the change we can bring with the resources of PayPal focused correctly, then why not drop me a line. I always have room for top talent.

A lack of a shared understanding means you will have have to lots of documentation. Having documentation that is predictive in an iterative environment is problematic. It is not realistic since you need to be able to change assumptions and solutions early in the cycle. Historical documentation becomes more necessary as teams downstream need them.<br /><br />A good way to alleviate much of the documentation normally needed is to pull the teams that are normally downstream (like QA, Localization QA, Localization, etc.) and bring them up further in the earlier cycles. Additionally you can create tools earlier in the process that proxy for these teams and reduce the number of those representatives you will need. Tools downstream should be automation driven as much as possible.<br /><br />In a recent LeanUX project I kept referring to a/b testing. At some point it became apparent that not all the team understood what I meant by a/b testing (remember this is what I ate, drank &amp; slept at Netflix). It was an easy solve to get us a shared understanding, but the mistake was assuming we had one already on all topics.<br /><br /><h3>2. Collaborate, Collaborate, Collaborate</h3><div>Walls between teams get erected whenever teams get big, become overly specialized and work in isolation.

In addition, we have been using <a href=\"http://node.js/\">node.js</a> as the underpinning for building our user experience code in a rapid, high iteration fashion. And even more exciting we are working on getting node.js to the point of production ready to build our app stack on top of it.<br /><br />In addition, <a href=\"lean-ux-agile-development-rationalizing-the-two-methodologies\" target=\"_blank\">we have been</a> pioneering <a href=\"http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/07/lean-ux-getting-out-of-the-deliverables-business/\" target=\"_blank\">Lean UX</a> as a working model that puts our user interface engineers in the room directly with product &amp; design to help lead our new experiences.<br /><br />And we have been hiring some <a href=\"welcome-crock\" target=\"_blank\">great talent</a>.<br /><br />Speaking of talent, I need to find a great manager for one of our most important teams -- the Wallet team. All of the consumer experiences fall under this area and cover desktop, tablet and mobile. We are also leading the charge on mobile first and the wallet team has many exciting opportunities to rethink the consumer's wallet across these channels.<br /><br />Here is a link to the job description:<br /><a href=\"http://jobs.ebaycareers.com/silicon-valley/user-experience/jobid3066378-sr-uie-manager-wallet-paypal-jobs\">http://jobs.ebaycareers.com/silicon-valley/user-experience/jobid3066378-sr-uie-manager-wallet-paypal-jobs</a><br /><br />What am I looking for? You should be passionate about all things front end. You should have a good solid history of writing and delivering front end applications in JavaScript and have a strong understanding of all of the industry best practices as well as the industry trends and key open source projects. Some experience with node is a plus.<br /><br />What do I need you to do? Since the team is about a dozen in size, I don't need you coding on a daily basis. What I want you to do instead is to take this great team to greater heights. Inspire them. Grow them. Mentor them. Help instill great engineering into the team (continuous integration/deployment/social coding). I also need you to be passionate about experience. And passionate about delivering this experience to multiple channels.

Over time the blog became more popular and really outgrew what I would want to do with it on Blogger.\n\nBut inertia is a terrible thing ;-) I remember having a conversation with [Matt Mullenweg](http://ma.tt/) (founder of WordPress) 7 years ago and he told me how easy it was to migrate my blog to Wordpress. I promised I would since it was a much better platform. But I never did it. It just always felt like a little less important than all the other things in my life.\n\n5 yrs ago, [Theresa Neil](http://www.theresaneil.com/) & I released our book [Designing Web Interfaces](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596516258/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596516258&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=looksgoodwork-20) (and yes it is sorely in need of an update) and a [companion blog](http://designingwebinterfaces.com/) on Wordpress. I liked Wordpress, but I didn't love Wordpress. I think it had to do mostly with having to hack away in PHP. Mind you I don't hate PHP. I just don't love it. Due to this I found even less reason to move the blog over. I mean if I am going to move to a new blog platform I better really like the environment and believe in its mission.\n\n### Enter Ghost\nI was really excited when the Ghost blog platform was [started on kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform/). It combined several things I really liked.\n\n#### 1. Markdown for Editing\nI really hate writing a blog post and having to mess with a rich text editor or having to think about markup. I just want to write something. Blogger was terrible in the markup it generated. I felt dirty every time I wrote something. Not a nice thing to have run through your mind while trying to inspire the masses.\n\nBut markdown -- now that is a [different story](http://www.fastcolabs.com/3015487/john-gruber-and-jeff-atwood-explain-why-markdown-is-still-growing-up.\n\nOne of the challenges you face when you are in a field for a long time is you get too comfortable with a particular set of tools. Github introduced me to the simplicity and beauty of markdown for writing. In fact the current book I am writing, I use the Mac app [Ulysses](http://www.ulyssesapp.com/) which has a  nice markdown environment.\n\nIn Ghost, markdown becomes the lingua franca of blogging. It has a simple [side-by-side markdown/preview editor](https://ghost.org/features/), which allows you to focus on the writing and not on the formatting.\n\n#### 2. NodeJS as the platform\nIn case you didn't know, [I love NodeJS](http://www.looksgoodworkswell.com/fluent-talk-releasing-the-kraken-clash-of-the-titans-nodejs-paypal/). It has helped us start a revolution at PayPal for our engineers and soon for our customers as experiences will start rolling out faster in 2014.\n\nThe good news is Ghost is built on NodeJS. Not PHP. And not some bizarre 2001 platform like Blogger. Given that it is node I can spin up my blog locally or host it on nodejitsu (or any other cloud supporting node) or I can host it on ghost itself for a nominal monthly fee.\n\nKnowing how your blog works -- from how it stores your blog content, how it renders it, and how it gets deployed is really attractive to me. It's also perfect that I can keep [my blog as a git repo](https://github.com/billwscott/lgww-ghost).\n\n#### 3. JavaScript Templating for Themes\nIt's simple to [grab themes](http://marketplace.ghost.org/) or [write your own](http://docs.ghost.org/themes/) themes. It uses [Handlebars templating](http://handlebarsjs.com/) so it is simple to work with. Ghost provides a hosted solution. Currently there is limited access, so as of this writing you will need to [signup for an invite](https://ghost.org/signup/). Once you download a theme, it is straightforward to [hack your theme](http://docs.ghost.org/themes/), run it locally (or on another platform like nodejitsu) for testing. Then when you are ready to use the theme live, just upload it to the ghost.io platform and you have your new look & feel.\n\n### Moving from Blogger to Ghost\nSince Ghost is still early on, there are no direct import tools to bring Blogger posts to Ghost. What I did was use the [Blogger to Wordpress export](https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/97416?hl=en) to create a dump of my blog posts. I then set up a temporary wordpress blog on one of my Dreamhost sites and imported the posts there.\n\n#### Getting the Posts to Ghost\nI installed the \"[Wordpress to Ghost plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ghost/) in my temp Wordpress blog. From there I was able to export a JSON file suitable for Ghost to import.\n\nBecause I could install Ghost locally it was easy to import the JSON file and verify that all 200+ posts had made it over correctly. Of course I found issues. There were links to images stored on blogger, links to resources that were scattered all over one of my servers and some links were hardcoded to the blogspot blog. Nothing broken in the import. Just my own sloppiness over time.\n\nThis gave me a chance to clean up all the links, and formulate a better strategy for where to put files for my blog and so on. It actually felt good to clean up 9 years of crufty stuff.\n\n#### Hosting Decisions\nI experimented with hosting the new blog on nodejitsu. The big issue right now is jitsu deploys are destructive so each deploy blows away your content (the blog database is stored in the content directory and thus pushed with the deploy). [Martijn Swaagman](https://github.com/Swaagie) has helpfully written a [persistent-ghost wrapper](https://github.com/nodejitsu/persistent-ghost) for nodejitsu that allows you to install ghost with the jitsu CLI and `jitsu deploy`. This copies the database out to its mongo grid, does the actual deploy and then restores the blog post from the mongo backup. Yes, it is admittedly a hack, but it seems to work fine. However, I did run into an issue with running my blog locally in this configuration. The node module `node_sqlite3` doesn't install correctly with `node-gyp` so you have to do a [manual install](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/issues/228) instead.\n\nIn the end I decided to just go with the Ghost hosted platform. I figured I would get better support, better analytics, automatic upgrades, and managed hosting.\n\nBut in any case, having the ability to run your blog locally or on any node-based cloud solution is a fantastic solution. Even if Ghost.org failed as a company, I have the blog software (it is open sourced) and can deploy it and manage in any way I see fit.\n\n#### Themes\nFor the theme, I started with a nice simple one called [WillSong](http://marcosn.com/willsong-ghost-theme/). I did a slight hack (which I will contribute back to his project) to get it to be a little better at responsiveness for mobile. I also added a third column for a bio area and other blog information. \n\nWhat I like most about the themes is they are easy to change. The templating is based on Handlebars and you can use any client side technologies to power the rest of the theme. Since a theme is self-contained, you just zip it up and can upload it to the hosted blog and you have the new look & feel.\n\n### The Real Test\nFor me the real test will be how more likely I will be to blog on a consistent basis. A lot of my current thinking goes into tweets or into presentations. However, just writing this blog post in Ghost was so much easier than writing it on blogger (or even wordpress) that it has me hopeful.\n\nWill let you know how it progresses in a few months.\n\nYou can [subscribe to the rss feed](http://www.looksgoodworkswell.com/rss/)  or you can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/billwscott) where I will always tweet when I have a new article posted.\n\nAnyone else plannng to use Ghost?\n","html":"<p>I am excited to announce that I have moved my blog from <a href=\"http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com\">Blogger</a> to <a href=\"http://www.looksgoodworkswell.com\">Ghost</a>, a NodeJS blogging platform.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"background\">Background</h3>\n\n<p>In 2005 when I started the blog, the easiest thing to do was to snag a blogspot account and start posting.

Given that it is node I can spin up my blog locally or host it on nodejitsu (or any other cloud supporting node) or I can host it on ghost itself for a nominal monthly fee.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing how your blog works -- from how it stores your blog content, how it renders it, and how it gets deployed is really attractive to me. It's also perfect that I can keep <a href=\"https://github.com/billwscott/lgww-ghost\">my blog as a git repo</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"3javascripttemplatingforthemes\">3. JavaScript Templating for Themes</h4>\n\n<p>It's simple to <a href=\"http://marketplace.ghost.org/\">grab themes</a> or <a href=\"http://docs.ghost.org/themes/\">write your own</a> themes. It uses <a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com/\">Handlebars templating</a> so it is simple to work with. Ghost provides a hosted solution. Currently there is limited access, so as of this writing you will need to <a href=\"https://ghost.org/signup/\">signup for an invite</a>. Once you download a theme, it is straightforward to <a href=\"http://docs.ghost.org/themes/\">hack your theme</a>, run it locally (or on another platform like nodejitsu) for testing. Then when you are ready to use the theme live, just upload it to the ghost.io platform and you have your new look &amp; feel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"movingfrombloggertoghost\">Moving from Blogger to Ghost</h3>\n\n<p>Since Ghost is still early on, there are no direct import tools to bring Blogger posts to Ghost. What I did was use the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/97416?hl=en\">Blogger to Wordpress export</a> to create a dump of my blog posts. I then set up a temporary wordpress blog on one of my Dreamhost sites and imported the posts there.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"gettingthepoststoghost\">Getting the Posts to Ghost</h4>\n\n<p>I installed the \"<a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/ghost/\">Wordpress to Ghost plugin</a> in my temp Wordpress blog. From there I was able to export a JSON file suitable for Ghost to import.</p>\n\n<p>Because I could install Ghost locally it was easy to import the JSON file and verify that all 200+ posts had made it over correctly. Of course I found issues. There were links to images stored on blogger, links to resources that were scattered all over one of my servers and some links were hardcoded to the blogspot blog. Nothing broken in the import. Just my own sloppiness over time.</p>\n\n<p>This gave me a chance to clean up all the links, and formulate a better strategy for where to put files for my blog and so on. It actually felt good to clean up 9 years of crufty stuff.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"hostingdecisions\">Hosting Decisions</h4>\n\n<p>I experimented with hosting the new blog on nodejitsu. The big issue right now is jitsu deploys are destructive so each deploy blows away your content (the blog database is stored in the content directory and thus pushed with the deploy). <a href=\"https://github.com/Swaagie\">Martijn Swaagman</a> has helpfully written a <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejitsu/persistent-ghost\">persistent-ghost wrapper</a> for nodejitsu that allows you to install ghost with the jitsu CLI and <code>jitsu deploy</code>. This copies the database out to its mongo grid, does the actual deploy and then restores the blog post from the mongo backup. Yes, it is admittedly a hack, but it seems to work fine. However, I did run into an issue with running my blog locally in this configuration. The node module <code>node_sqlite3</code> doesn't install correctly with <code>node-gyp</code> so you have to do a <a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/issues/228\">manual install</a> instead.</p>\n\n<p>In the end I decided to just go with the Ghost hosted platform. I figured I would get better support, better analytics, automatic upgrades, and managed hosting.</p>\n\n<p>But in any case, having the ability to run your blog locally or on any node-based cloud solution is a fantastic solution. Even if Ghost.org failed as a company, I have the blog software (it is open sourced) and can deploy it and manage in any way I see fit.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"themes\">Themes</h4>\n\n<p>For the theme, I started with a nice simple one called <a href=\"http://marcosn.com/willsong-ghost-theme/\">WillSong</a>. I did a slight hack (which I will contribute back to his project) to get it to be a little better at responsiveness for mobile. I also added a third column for a bio area and other blog information. </p>\n\n<p>What I like most about the themes is they are easy to change. The templating is based on Handlebars and you can use any client side technologies to power the rest of the theme. Since a theme is self-contained, you just zip it up and can upload it to the hosted blog and you have the new look &amp; feel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"therealtest\">The Real Test</h3>\n\n<p>For me the real test will be how more likely I will be to blog on a consistent basis. A lot of my current thinking goes into tweets or into presentations. However, just writing this blog post in Ghost was so much easier than writing it on blogger (or even wordpress) that it has me hopeful.</p>\n\n<p>Will let you know how it progresses in a few months.</p>\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"http://www.looksgoodworkswell.com/rss/\">subscribe to the rss feed</a>  or you can <a href=\"http://twitter.com/billwscott\">follow me on twitter</a> where I will always tweet when I have a new article posted.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone else plannng to use Ghost?</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2013-12-25T01:25:35.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2013-12-26T03:18:18.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2013-12-25T02:48:02.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":208,"uuid":"14ac5de9-4e54-4193-9457-7a3100ceb0db","title":"My First \"Hour of Code\"","slug":"my-first-hour-of-code","markdown":"During the week of Dec 9-15th over a half billion lines of code [were written](http://csedweek.org/) for the hour of code initiative by over 20 million people.\n\n![Image of code on screen. From http://www.flickr.com/photos/rinoshea/7702900836/ use under CC-by-NC license](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8022/7702900836_0106e4e49a.jpg)\n\nThis got me reflecting on my own original \"hour of code\". It was a seminal moment in my life. I had never seen a real computer before this point in my life, much less ever programmed one. But one moment during my \"hour of code\" opened my eyes to the wonders of programming and set my career direction for life.\n\n### 1976\nOk, this will date me. Between my Junior & Senior year in high school, I had the honor of attending a weeklong computer programming camp at my local state university (Stephen F. Austin). \n\nThink back to [1976](http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/?year=1976). Steve Wozniak had just built the Apple I computer board for hobbyist. Gary Kildall created CP/M which would become the most popular operating system until MS-DOS dethroned it a few years later. Punched cards were still in vogue. And in my small town in East Texas there was no computer access for a mere mortal in high school.\n\n### Wang Series 700\nOur computer for the week was the Wang Series 700 Programmable Desktop Calculator. Lest the word \"calculator\" conjures up something you slide into your pocket, take a look at this beauty:\n\n![Wang Series 700 Programmable Desktop Calculator](http://www.technikum29.de/shared/photos/rechnertechnik/wang700-detail.jpg)\n\nBy the power of the internet I was able to locate both an [emulator](http://wang700.durgadas.com/) and the original [programming manual](http://www.wass.net/manuals/Wang%20700.pdf)!\n\nThe emulator does the best job of clearly showing what my first programming experience was like.\n\n![Screenshot of the Series 700 Emulator](http://billwscott.com/files/wang-700-emu.png)\n\nProgramming the calculator was really more akin to assembly language programming. Two of the keypads have logic commands, program controls, and register manipulation.\n\n### Programming the Series 700\nWhen you are in the \"learn\" mode pressing keys enters them into core memory registers and assigns the equivalent machine code to each instruction. You can think of the keys as the assembly language instructions that map to the appropriate program codes. Just like in any assembly language you spend your time being mindful of registers and where and when you put values and retrieve them. \n\n![Wang Series 700 programming pad](http://billwscott.com/files/wang-700-prog-pad.png)\n\nThe key instructions for branching are **Skip If Error**, **Skip If Y >= X**, **Skip If Y = X**, and **Skip if Y < X**. The keys **Mark** and **Search** mark or goto a \"named\" line in the code.  \n\nNotice the display has two rows of numbers. The top row displays the Y-register. The bottom row displays the X-register.\n\n![Wang Series 700 programming keypads](http://billwscott.com/files/wang-700-display.png)\n\nThe calculator also had a set of function keys that mapped to additional registers. The flip switches extended the range for a total of 120 registers.\n\n![Wang Series 700 programming keypads](http://billwscott.com/files/wang-700-registers.png)\n\nYou can control the values stored and retrieved in these registers with the register keypad.\n\n![Wang Series 700 programming pad](http://billwscott.com/files/wang-700-reg-pad.png)\n\nThe calculator also included indirect addressing (putting a value in a register that is in turn the register address to store or retrieve a value).\n\nHere is a typical program, complete with looping logic.\n\n![Wang Series 700 example program](http://billwscott.com/files/wang-700-program.png)\n\n### My Hour of Code\nAs the week wound to a close we were given this challenge: _given a sufficiently large number, write a program that would determine if the number was prime or not_.\n\nFrom my vantage point today, this seems like a pretty trivial problem to solve. But step into my 1976 shoes. No internet. No programming books (just the Wang programming manual). I had never seen a computer before nor had I programmed one before.\n\nIt was Thursday evening. The assignment was due the next day. After grabbing a quick bite to eat I headed over to the Computer Science Lab to start working on the problem in earnest. Of course the first approach I took was brute force. Iterate over all numbers (f) up to the number in question (x). Divide f into x and then look for a left over value (remainder). If I found a factor that divided evenly then the number was not prime. I realized quickly that I could divide the set of factors by 2 as an optimization.\n\nOk, simple enough I thought. I ran the program. It took a long time.\n\nIt was at this moment that I had an epiphany. The highest factor possible was a factor (f) that when multiplied times itself (f^2) would exceed the value of number x in question and thus be as far as I would need check as a factor! In other words I could just take the square root of the number (x) and try factors (f) up to that square.\n\nWhen I ran the new program, instead of taking an hour to run, it only took a couple of minutes!\n\nThe next day was the real payoff. I ended up being the only one to complete the assignment. The instructor suggested we load my program, break for lunch and come back and check the result later since it would take a while to run. I mentioned that it actually should just take a couple of minutes. He gave me a look of disbelief but decided to humor me (he figured I had written a faulty program). We ran it and it finished in a couple of minutes with the right answer.\n\nThe look on his face was priceless. After class he took me to his office to encourage me to pursue a career in computer science. I have to say that this single experience shaped my love for computing and my belief that I could excel in this field.\n\nIt was this hour of coding that did it for me. That first exposure was magical.\n\n(Of course I went home and could only code on paper and \"play the computer\" with all the new algorithms I was writing.)\n\n### The Beauty of Coding\nThat Thursday night I discovered the beauty of coding. The ability to come up with an algorithm that solves a problem and solves it more elegantly than what has come before (or at least what I knew of). Interestingly what I had stumbled upon is known as the [Trial by Division Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division) which is a variation of the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). Unknown to me, [David Turner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Turner_(computer_scientist)), the computer scientist, had devised a Trial by Division algorithm [using functional programming in 1975](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#cite_note-10) just a year before my amateur effort.\n\nOf course these algorithms were discovered thousands of years ago. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is more efficent than Trial by Division. And in Eratosthenes' day the sieve was simpler than division (and a lot faster). But on the Wang Series 700 where memory was precious, Trial by Division was actually the better approach.\n\nFor those interested there are [many](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test) [improvements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Atkin) [over](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division) my very simple algorithm. And prime factorization is a key component of cryptology and remains a fascinating area of computer science and math to study.\n\n### Your Hour of Code\n\nIf you haven't had your hour of coding or know someone who you would like to have that magical moment, send them over to [Learn to Code](http://code.org/learn) or [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/hour-of-code/hour-of-code-tutorial/v/welcome-hour-of-code) start learning to code.\n\nDo you have an hour of coding story?\n\n\n<small>_[This article's cover image is from Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rinoshea/7702900836/) used under the creative commons [by-nc-sa](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/) license</small>_\n","html":"<p>During the week of Dec 9-15th over a half billion lines of code <a href=\"http://csedweek.org/\">were written</a> for the hour of code initiative by over 20 million people.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8022/7702900836_0106e4e49a.jpg\" alt=\"Image of code on screen.

Debugging the Mac meant hitting the [Programmer's Switch](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/blog/2012/08/22/programmers-switch/) that all of us developers had installed. It would in turn open up a [MacsBug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacsBug) session.\n\n\nOn this particular day I was curious how MacPaint was so fast at re-rendering the canvas drawing area. You could especially see this during an undo operation. I knew that it was using an off-screen buffer and had to bitblit it back to the screen. I also knew that this was all done in software. So how to find out? I decided to do lots of undos while quickly hitting the interrupt switch.\n\nI noticed that I landed on a certain piece of code in almost every situation. Here is this [same piece of code](http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/macpaint-and-quickdraw-source-code/) courtesy of the Computer History Museum's addition of the MacPaint and the QuickDraw source code to its archives. This is nice because we have [Bill Atkinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson)'s comments, which I didn't have back in the day. \n\n![MacPaint source code for BufToScrn](http://billwscott.com/files/macpaint-buf-to-scrn-src.png)\n\nThe key to this really fast render operation was the use of the Motorola 68k's MOVEM command. MOVEM stands for Move Multiple. It can take a range of registers and move bits from an address into the M68k registers or do the reverse.\n\nHere is how this algorithm worked:\n\n![MacPaint BufToScrn Illustrated](http://billwscott.com/files/macpaint-buf-to-scrn-explained.png)\n\nIn this example there are a few \"on\" bits at the top of the lady's hair. You can see that the MOVEM.L (A0),D0-D7/A2-A6 moves long words (32 bits) from the pointer at A0 (which is the memory location of the portion of the screen buffer being copied). Notice the registers get populated with the bits from the buffer. Registers D4-D7 have lots of 1's which represent a row of her black hair.\n\nThe next MOVEM.L D0-D7/A2-A6,(A1) moves the contents of the registers to the screen. A1 points to the start of the screen memory. The (A1) in parenthesis in M68k assembler denotes indirect addressing (btw, I have always felt that M68k assembler was a joy to work with).\n\nNow this is all fine and dandy. But the real epiphany to me was when I discovered this algorithm was the reason the MacPaint drawing area was 416 pixels wide. The drawing area is evenly divisible by 13 long words (13x32=416). This is exactly the number of registers that were available in the loop above for the MOVEM.L operation. <s>(It appears it could have used 14 registers, but I am guessing the extra 32 pixels would have made the drawing area more cramped by reducing the gray whitespace)</s> **UPDATE: several readers [helpfully pointed out](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6982253) that only 13 registers were truly available. The other was reserved for the stack pointer (and the other two utilized as mentioned above). I remember \"knowing\" that only 13 were available back then when I discovered this, but when I wrote this article the fog of time had erased the true reason.**\n\nIt was fascinating to me that this particular M68k operation drove the visual design of the original, iconic, MacPaint application.\n\nOf course one can critique it now and point out well what happens when you add color. And when you have a resizable window? But remember, this was the age of the Mac 128k, running on a 68k at 8Mhz. The ROM itself was just 64k and all of the core graphics (Quickdraw) was squeezed into 24k. This was an algorithm born of necessity. Without this optimization the original MacPaint would have been sluggish in many of its operations (the ScrnToBuf and the BufToScreen are foundational to MacPaint).\n\nUPDATE: There are some good conversations about this article on [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6982253) and [reddit](http://i.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1tzgyd/why_macpaints_window_size_was_416_pixels/).
